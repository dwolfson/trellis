# Trellis — Quickstart

From a fresh clone to a running app. Fifteen minutes, most of it waiting for model downloads.

Trellis is a `uv` workspace holding two apps and six shared libraries. You do not need to
understand the whole thing to run one app — start with the [10-minute path](#the-10-minute-path).

**You need a running Egeria platform.** Both apps sign you in against Egeria, so Egeria is the
identity provider and therefore a hard dependency — the "answers questions without an Egeria
platform" path this guide used to describe was retired on 2026-09-04 (project owner's decision;
see `docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §4).

For what the repo *is* and why it is one repo, see [README.md](README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Check |
|---|---|---|
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) | Dependency + workspace manager | `uv --version` |
| Docker | Postgres with the pgvector extension | `docker ps` |
| [Ollama](https://ollama.com) | Local LLM, the default backend | `ollama --version` |

Python itself is handled by `uv` from `.python-version` — you do not need to install it.

**Required: an Egeria platform.** It is what both apps authenticate against — login is required
and there is no local user store, so without Egeria there is no way to sign in. An
`egeria-quickstart` deployment at `https://localhost:9443` is the usual local answer. Set it in
each app's `.env` (`EGERIA_VIEW_SERVER_URL`, `EGERIA_VIEW_SERVER`, `EGERIA_USER`).

`TRELLIS_ANONYMOUS_READ=true` relaxes this on a development box — unauthenticated `GET`/`HEAD`
pass, writes still require a signed-in user — but it is a dev-only override, not a supported way
to run without Egeria.

## The 10-minute path

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwolfson/trellis.git
cd trellis
uv sync
```

One shared `.venv` at the repo root, for every workspace member.

### 2. Start Postgres

Both apps share one database. If you already run the `egeria-shared-postgres` container from an
`egeria-workspaces` checkout, it is running — skip to creating the schema.

```bash
docker run -d --name trellis-postgres -p 5442:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=egeria_advisor \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=egeria_advisor \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=advisor \
  pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

Resource Explorer keeps its tables in a named schema, which is the one thing that is not
created for you:

```bash
docker exec trellis-postgres psql -U egeria_advisor -d egeria_advisor \
  -c 'CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS resource_explorer AUTHORIZATION egeria_advisor;'
```

Everything else — tables, vector collections — is created on first use.

### 3. Pull a model

```bash
ollama serve &          # skip if it runs as a service
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

That one model is enough for Q&A in both apps. Egeria Advisor's governance-plan authoring also
wants `qwen2.5-coder:32b` (~20GB) — leave it until you need it.

### 4. Configure

```bash
cp packages/resource-explorer/.env.example packages/resource-explorer/.env
cp packages/egeria-advisor/.env.example packages/egeria-advisor/.env
```

The defaults point at the Postgres and Ollama you just started. To let Resource Explorer read
GitHub at a sensible rate limit, add a token to its `.env`:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

Without one you get 60 API calls an hour, which is enough to look around and not enough to
survey much.

### 5. Run

```bash
make up         # preflight + shared JWT secret + start both   ← start here
make re-web     # Resource Explorer → http://localhost:8810
make ea-web     # Egeria Advisor    → http://localhost:8880
make dev        # both at once; Ctrl-C stops both
```

Prefer `make up` on a fresh box: it generates the shared `TRELLIS_JWT_SECRET` both apps need
(without it, sessions silently stop surviving restarts) and tells you if Egeria, Postgres or
Ollama is not up, instead of letting the app fail later. `make check` runs those checks and
starts nothing.

`make help` lists every target.

### 6. First real action

**Resource Explorer** — add a repo and ask about it:

```bash
uv run --package resource-explorer resource-explorer add \
  https://github.com/odpi/egeria-python --yes
```

`add` runs an onboarding wizard that proposes which collections to index; `--yes` accepts its
proposals instead of prompting. Drop the flag to choose them yourself.

Then open <http://localhost:8810>, pick the repo in the sidebar, and use **🔍 Scouting**.
Ingestion runs as part of `add` and takes a few minutes — pick a small repo first. `odpi/egeria`
itself is large enough to be a poor first choice.

**Egeria Advisor** — open <http://localhost:8880>, sign in with your Egeria user id and
password, then ask *"what is a governance zone?"*. The answer comes from its own bundled corpus,
so nothing needs indexing first; the sign-in is what lets anything it creates be attributed to
you in Egeria.

From the terminal, cache a session once instead of signing in per command:

```bash
uv run --package egeria-advisor egeria-advisor login        # prompts for the password
uv run --package egeria-advisor egeria-advisor "what is a governance zone?"
```

Egeria's tokens last an hour and every one of them dies when the platform restarts, so expect to
run `login` again; commands that need Egeria say so in one line when the session has lapsed.

## The full path

Everything above already needs the Egeria platform you configured in the prerequisites. These are
what you do with it:

- **Survey and catalog a resource.** Resource Explorer writes survey results into Egeria as
  the catalog of record. Start at [Resource Explorer's user guide](packages/resource-explorer/docs/user-guide.md).
- **Run a Survey Definition.** Named, ordered bundles of analysis steps authored in Egeria via
  Dr.Egeria documents — see [survey-definitions.md](packages/resource-explorer/docs/survey-definitions.md).
- **Author governance plans.** Egeria Advisor's literate-governance flow — see
  [LITERATE_GOVERNANCE_GUIDE.md](packages/egeria-advisor/docs/user-docs/LITERATE_GOVERNANCE_GUIDE.md).

If Egeria has been reset or reseeded and Resource Explorer's cached GUIDs no longer resolve,
[egeria-reset-recovery.md](packages/resource-explorer/docs/egeria-reset-recovery.md) is written
from a real reset rather than from theory.

## Optional services

None of these are needed to run either app; all are off unless configured.

| Service | Default | What it adds | Start it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prefect | `localhost:4200` | Real flow-run state, per-step logs and cancellation for survey steps | `make prefect-up` |
| Kroki | `localhost:6002` | Server-rendered ER diagrams (database views only) | shared-infra compose |
| MLflow | `localhost:5025` | Experiment tracking | `mlflow server --port 5025` |
| Phoenix | `localhost:6006` | LLM tracing | `python -m phoenix.server.main` |

With Prefect enabled and no server running, steps still fall back to running in-process — just
slower by one connection attempt per step. Prefect itself stays off by default (`PREFECT_ENABLED`
defaults to `False`) because leaving it enabled with no server reachable used to leak an ephemeral
subprocess server that nothing shut down (13 found orphaned on one machine, 2026-09-04) — RE now
also forces `PREFECT_SERVER_EPHEMERAL_ENABLED=false` as a second guard regardless of this setting.
Enable it only where a compose service actually provides Prefect (egeria-workspaces'
`optional-associated-runtimes/prefect`), setting both `PREFECT_ENABLED=true` and `PREFECT_API_URL`
explicitly.

---

## Verifying your setup

```bash
make test          # both packages
make test-re       # Resource Explorer only
make test-ea       # Egeria Advisor only
```

Tests that need Postgres skip themselves when it is unreachable rather than failing, so a green
run does not by itself prove your database is wired up. The honest check is step 6 above.

## When something is wrong

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `relation "..." does not exist` from Resource Explorer | The `resource_explorer` schema was never created — step 2 |
| Empty or "I don't have enough information" answers | Ollama is not running, or the model was never pulled |
| GitHub calls failing after a few minutes | No `GITHUB_TOKEN`; you are on the 60/hour anonymous limit |
| Egeria calls failing | Expected without a platform — the 10-minute path does not need one |
| A survey reports zero findings | May be honest. Both apps distinguish *measured zero* from *never ran*; check the result's own status rather than assuming |
