"""EA's startup and shutdown hooks run (Phase 1 Q1).

The regression this catches has happened: TC-5 slice 1 (2026-09) deleted app.py's startup and
shutdown handlers along with the block being moved out, and nothing failed. Every test used a bare
`TestClient(app)`, which never runs lifespan events. A peer only noticed by diffing a redeployed
container's startup behaviour (see the `_startup` docstring in advisor/web/app.py).

Here the app is entered with `with TestClient(app):`, so startup and shutdown run, and each hook is
replaced by a recorder:
  - PgVectorStore.provision_schema   (pgvector tables exist before the first query)
  - the MCP warm-up                  (ReportPipeline._ensure_agent, in a background thread)
  - start_background_sync            (report specs held in Egeria, brief B3)
  - shutdown_mcp_agent               (no orphaned MCP subprocess on reload)

No Postgres, no MCP server, no Egeria: nothing real is started. This test only imports app.py.
