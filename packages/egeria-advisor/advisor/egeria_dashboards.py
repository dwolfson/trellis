"""Dashboard Sheets held in Egeria, read-only (brief EA-CATCHUP-AND-DASHBOARDS B5, decisions D4 and D6).

EA lists the Dashboard Sheets Egeria holds and shows one, AS THE SIGNED-IN USER. The data step is
pyegeria's (`pyegeria.view.dashboard_resolver`, the same step the Portal uses, D4); the display, the cache
and the sign-in are EA's own.

Visibility (§4.7 of the brief), stated here because the cache is where it would leak:
  - Every Egeria read here is made with the viewer's own bearer token (`apply_token`). There is no
    service-user fallback: with no token there is nothing to read as, so the caller is told to sign in.
    Egeria's zone check on that read decides what the viewer sees: a sheet in a zone they cannot see is
    not listed and reads as "not visible"; a Report or an EGERIA-tier ReportSpec in such a zone comes back
    from the resolver as a "restricted" placement ("not visible to you"), never runnable.
  - The cache is keyed by CREDENTIAL IDENTITY: a hash of the token actually presented, plus the platform
    and view server (the Portal's `credential_identity` rule, 11-09). Never a bare user_id and never a
    token's unverified `sub`: a cache hit makes no Egeria call, so a claim-based key would let one user
    read another's entry. A renewed token is a new key. Nothing secret is stored.
  - Only answers are cached ("ok", "no sheets", "not visible"). A failed read is never cached, and a
    refused token is raised to the caller as a sign-in problem, never cached as an answer.
  - The EGERIA spec tier is filled by EA's service user into a shared cache (B3), so a spec found there
    may be one this viewer cannot see. The resolver re-reads such a spec by GUID as the viewer
    (`check_spec_visibility=True`): Egeria's own check is the authority over the shared tier.

Absence is not zero: "no sheets" (Egeria answered and holds none this viewer can see), "could not read"
(Egeria did not answer), and "not visible" (no sheet of that name for this viewer) are three answers with
three messages.
