"""EA's feedback, kept in the shared `trellis-feedback` library (Phase 2, A-F1).

Every chat vote is an `answer` item in the library's `trellis_feedback_items` table, with:
- the signed-in user (anonymous: ""), the question, the full answer text;
- the intent label, the perspective and the routing agent.

A vote's status is the latest of its append-only triage events, which only admins write, through
the library's router (mounted at `/api/feedback/v2` by `advisor.web.feedback`). Nothing in EA is
keyed by a line position any more: an item's id is its only handle.

This replaces two JSONL files under the data root:
- `feedback/user_feedback.jsonl`, the collector's record;
- `feedback/feedback_extended.jsonl`, the full record that triage edited by line index.

Neither is written any more. `scripts/import_feedback_jsonl.py` copies both in once
(`advisor.feedback_import`), and they stay on disk.

Where the store lives:
- `ADVISOR_FEEDBACK_DATABASE_URL`, when set, is the URL as given. Tests use SQLite.
- Otherwise EA's own Postgres, from the same `PGVECTOR_*` settings as the rest of EA.
- The tables are in the schema `ADVISOR_FEEDBACK_SCHEMA` (default `egeria_advisor`), one schema per
  app as the design asks (docs/trellis-feedback-extraction.md §4 item 4). SQLite ignores the schema.

The same pattern as RE's `resource_explorer/feedback_store.py` (adoption PRs #1013/#1014): one library
store per URL per process, opened on first use. Opening it can fail (Postgres down); that is
`StoreUnavailable`, carrying the database's first line, never a silent empty store.
