"""Zone-restricted report specs, per signed-in user, and the "Used by" consumer index (brief B6).

The shared EGERIA tier (advisor/egeria_spec_sync.py) holds public specs only: pyegeria's shared-cache
sync skips any spec that carries a governance zone (§9). A restricted spec is therefore read here,
**as the signed-in user's token**, with pyegeria's `list_visible_restricted_specs`; Egeria's zone check
decides what comes back, so each user sees exactly the restricted specs their zones allow.

Cache rule: the result is cached per **credential identity** (a hash of the token presented, plus the
platform and view server: `egeria_dashboards.credential_identity`), never by bare user id. Two sessions
of one user id can hold different zone grants; a cache keyed on the id would leak one into the other.
Nothing read here is ever written to the shared cache or registered in the shared registry.

Running one: `run_restricted_spec` fetches the spec from Egeria for that call, as the user
(`exec_report_spec(..., refresh_spec=True)`), never from a shared copy.

Absence is stated: no sign-in, a pyegeria without the function, folders not read, and "read, and
nothing restricted is visible to you" are four different answers, never one empty list.
