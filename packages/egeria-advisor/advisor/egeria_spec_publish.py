"""Publish an EA spec to Egeria, and withdraw it (brief B6, N1/N2).

**How.** Publishing writes a Dr.Egeria document and runs it **as the signed-in user's token**
(`DrEgeriaActionAgent.execute(..., egeria_credentials=...)`; never the service account, so Egeria
records the real person). The steps are fixed: **preview** (the document, nothing sent), **validate**
(Dr.Egeria's validate run), the user **confirms**, then **process**. The process step rebuilds the
document and refuses if it differs from the one the user previewed and confirmed.

**What.** One `Create Report Spec` (or `Update Report Spec` when the label is already held in Egeria),
then `Add Member to Collection` for each consumer folder:

- `ReportSpecFolder::Consumer::EgeriaAdvisor` always ("membership is publication");
- `ReportSpecFolder::Consumer::Portal` when asked.

**Visibility.** Public (the default) carries no zones. Restricted carries `Zone Membership` (a Basic
attribute since pyegeria 6.2.30); a restricted spec never enters EA's shared cache (pyegeria skips a
zoned spec there) and is read per user instead (advisor/egeria_spec_restricted.py). A blank Zone
Membership on an Update leaves the old zones in place (6.2.30), so re-publishing a restricted spec as
public adds `Declassify Zone Membership`.

**Hazard (memory dr_egeria_parent_id_update_hazard).** Never a Parent ID on the spec command, on Create
or Update: folder membership is only ever an `Add Member to Collection`, which is an upsert.

**Withdraw.** `Remove Member from Collection` from each consumer folder, as the user, after a confirm;
then a sync starts, so the catalog shows it gone.
