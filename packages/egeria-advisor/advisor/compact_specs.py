"""pyegeria's compact Dr.Egeria command specs, as packaged with the installed md_processing: read-only flags.

EA reads flags pyegeria declares per command or per family, without loading pyegeria's dispatcher
(md_processing's COMMAND_DEFINITIONS is empty until a dispatcher is set up):
  - `chat_allowed` (advisor.chat_command_policy): may a chat message compose this command;
  - `idempotent` (GovernancePlanAgent's re-run acknowledgement): is running it twice the same as once.

A flag on a command wins over one at the top of its family's file. Names compare without case, spaces,
underscores or hyphens, and a command's alternate_names are indexed too, so a plan's "## Create Term" finds
the spec that pyegeria calls "Create Glossary Term" when it lists that alternate.
