"""Thin reader over Resource Explorer's resource_explorer.project_code_symbols
/ project_code_relationships tables, exposing the same public method names/
shapes as advisor/code_symbol_store.py's CodeSymbolStore (the methods
advisor/analytics.py actually calls) — so analytics.py's call sites don't
need to change, only what backs them (AST-ownership-transfer plan Phase 7).

A new class rather than extending CodeSymbolStore itself: CodeSymbolStore is
still EA's own writer for (soon-to-be-deprecated, see plan Phase 8) code_symbols
/code_relationships — overloading it with a "which schema" flag would make one
class serve two unrelated data sources mid-migration. Every returned row is
aliased `project_slug AS collection` so analytics.py's existing formatting
code (which reads `row['collection']`) needs no changes.
