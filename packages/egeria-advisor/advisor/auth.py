"""
JWT-based authentication for Egeria Advisor — a thin adapter over the shared
`trellis-auth` package.

**Extraction note (2026-08-29):** this used to be a self-contained 255-line
module. The mechanism (JWT create/decode, request-header parsing, Portal
token exchange, live-credential validation) now lives in `trellis_auth` —
shared with Resource Explorer so the two apps can't independently drift on
the *contract with the Portal* (a shared-secret JWT agreement), which is the
kind of divergence this repo has hit before (query cache, annotation
properties, ...). See `docs/trellis-auth-extraction.md`.

**Contract change (2026-09-04): the session JWT carries the user's Egeria
bearer token, never their password.** Previously `create_access_token` signed
the raw Egeria password into the HS256 token and `get_egeria_credentials`
handed `{user_id, password}` to every live-Egeria call site, which then called
`create_egeria_bearer_token(user_id, password)` again on each request. The
Portal never issued the password-shaped token this module's SSO route expected
— it issues `{sub, role, display_name, egeria_token, exp}` — so
`POST /api/auth/portal` was wired to a payload nothing produced. Now:

  * the login form exchanges the password for an Egeria bearer token exactly
    once (`trellis_auth.login_with_password`) and forgets it;
  * `get_egeria_credentials(request)` still returns a dict — same name, same
    call shape, so the ~15 `egeria_credentials=` call sites are unchanged — but
    it is now `{user_id, password: "", token}`. `password` is always empty for
    an authenticated user; `token` is what live call sites must use, via
    `trellis_auth.apply_token(client, token)`.

**Login policy change (2026-09-04): login is required, and the policy is
shared.** Until now this module answered "does EA require login at all?" for
itself, from `advisor.yaml`'s `auth.enabled` / `auth.anonymous_rag_mode`. The
project owner's decision of 2026-09-04 moves that answer into `trellis-auth`
so both apps resolve it identically: `trellis_auth.resolve_policy("ADVISOR")`
reads `TRELLIS_REQUIRE_LOGIN` / `TRELLIS_ANONYMOUS_READ` (then the
`ADVISOR_*` forms, which win), and `LoginRequiredMiddleware` — installed in
`advisor/web/app.py` ahead of the user-context middleware — enforces it before
a route handler ever runs. `_auth_enabled()` and `_anonymous_rag_mode()` remain
as names, but they are now *derived from that policy* rather than independent
switches:

    _auth_enabled()       == policy.require_login
    _anonymous_rag_mode() == policy.anonymous_read

The two `advisor.yaml` keys are retired; a checkout that still carries them
gets one deprecation warning naming the env var that replaced them, and the
policy wins.

See `docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §4 and `docs/trellis-auth-extraction.md`.

What stays here, deliberately, because it's EA's own config, not
mechanism:
  * config file locations (`advisor/configdata/advisor.yaml`,
    `mcp_servers.json`) and reading the environment for secrets;
  * `get_current_user`/`require_egeria_user`/`is_authenticated`/
    `get_egeria_credentials` are re-implemented here (each just a few lines)
    on top of this module's own policy-aware `get_current_user` rather than
    delegated straight to `trellis_auth`'s versions of the same names, which
    have no notion of a policy-driven anonymous bypass;
  * `resolve_egeria_credentials`'s service-account fallback — deliberately
    excluded from `trellis_auth` (see its module docstring) per the
    2026-08-29 decision that artifact ownership requires an authenticated
    identity with NO config fallback. That decision is unchanged here: the
    fallback still only fires for an *anonymous* request, and it now yields a
    creds dict with an empty `token`, so a call site can tell "this is the
    service account" from "this is a signed-in person" by looking at `token`.
