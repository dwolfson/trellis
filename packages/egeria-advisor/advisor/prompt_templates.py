  2. `commands` (under `commands/` directory): Command-line tools (CLI) and interactive commands (like `hey_egeria`) written in Python using the `pyegeria` SDK.
  3. `dr_egeria` (under `md_processing/` directory): The Python implementation of the Dr. Egeria markdown processor which is used to parse, draft, and execute governance metadata template plans.
