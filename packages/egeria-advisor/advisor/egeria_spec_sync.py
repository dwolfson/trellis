"""
Report specs held in Egeria, for Egeria Advisor: the EGERIA tier (brief B3, D3).

EA used to read Egeria-held specs through pyegeria's "Phase-1" convention
(`load_egeria_report_specs`: QuestionSpec glossary terms in `ReportType::` collections). That
convention holds no data (0 collections, 2026-11-10) and is not where specs live now, so it is
retired. This module fills pyegeria's EGERIA registry tier instead, with
`pyegeria.view.egeria_spec_cache.sync_report_specs`, from EA's own consumer folder:

    ReportSpecFolder::Consumer::EgeriaAdvisor      (consumer-folders decision, 2026-11-10)

"Membership is publication": putting a ReportSpec in that folder publishes it to EA, removing it
unpublishes it.

Configuration
-------------
`ADVISOR_REPORT_SPEC_FOLDERS` (comma-separated CollectionFolder qualified names), else
`PYEGERIA_REPORT_SPEC_FOLDERS` (pyegeria's own variable, as the Portal uses it), else the default
above. Set either to an empty string to configure *no* folder; the catalog then says so.

When the sync runs
------------------
- At startup, in a daemon thread, retrying with backoff while Egeria comes up. **Startup never
  waits on Egeria.** The cache from the last sync is on disk, so the tier is usable before then.
- On demand: the admin "Sync report specs from Egeria" action.

Visibility (read this before B6)
--------------------------------
The sync reads as **EA's service account** (`resolve_egeria_credentials(None)`), never as a
signed-in user, and writes a **shared** cache (`shared=True`): every EA user sees what it holds.
That is right only for **public** specs. Two consequences:

- A spec the service account cannot see is simply absent here, even if a signed-in user could see
  it. The folder itself must stay public (consumer-folders D6): a zoned folder would make the
  whole consumer silently unpublish, which `folder_not_found` below reports as "not found, or not
  visible to <service account>".
- **Zone-restricted specs must never enter this shared cache** (EA brief §4.6 revised by D5).
  pyegeria's `sync_report_specs` has no `public_only` option yet (it is B6 work). Until it does,
  this sync relies on the folder holding no restricted specs: today nothing in EA's folder is
  zoned (the folder does not exist yet). When B6 lands, pass `public_only=True` here (see
  `_sync_kwargs`), report its skipped-restricted count, and read restricted specs per signed-in
  user, cached by credential identity, never through this module.

Recursion
---------
Consumer-folders D5: sync follows sub-folders *within* a consumer folder (cycle-safe, depth-capped).
That is pyegeria phase-2 work. `_sync_kwargs` passes `recursive=True` as soon as the installed
`sync_report_specs` accepts it; until then the sync reads the folder's direct members only, and
the status says so.

Absence
-------
`egeria_held_status()` never returns a bare empty list. It always says why nothing is held:
no folder configured / not synced yet / the folder was not found or is not visible / the folder
holds no active specs / the sync failed.
