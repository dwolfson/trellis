"""Code intelligence agent — answers maintainer-focused queries about codebase structure, inheritance, methods, and stats.

AST-ownership-transfer plan Phase 6: reads Resource Explorer's
resource_explorer.project_code_symbols / project_code_relationships tables
(same Postgres instance, same egeria_advisor database, cross-schema SQL —
no new connection/infra needed) instead of EA's own code_symbols /
code_relationships. RE now owns extraction (real tree-sitter for Java,
extended stdlib ast for Python) for the repos in RE's "egeria" project group
— egeria_git, egeria_docs, egeria_python_git, egeria_workspaces_git — which
is exactly EA's old scripts/clone_repos.py target set.

Two structural changes from the EA-owned version this replaces:
  - Scoped by project_slug (RE's whole-repo unit), not EA's finer `collection`
    subdivision. EA's `pyegeria` collection (fine-grained: excludes tests/
    CLI/dr_egeria markdown processor within the egeria-python repo) is
    reconstructed as a path-prefix filter within one project_slug via
    _SCOPES, rather than being a separate physical collection/table.
  - _relative_path()'s "data/repos/<repo>/" marker-stripping is gone — RE's
    file_path is already relative to the repo root (RE clones into an
    ephemeral tempdir, discarded after ingestion; this agent never reads
    files from disk, only displays the path string, so there was never a
    functional need for an absolute path).
