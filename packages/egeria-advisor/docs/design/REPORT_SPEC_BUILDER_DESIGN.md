# Report Spec Builder — Design Reference

**Last updated:** 2026-06-26

## Core concept

A **Report Spec** (also called a FormatSet) is a persistent **view definition** — it declares
what to fetch (`action_function`), what to show (`columns`), and how to filter and shape the
output.  It is *not* a one-time document; it is closer to a saved SQL view:

- Same spec + same parameters → repeatable, comparable output
- Users iterate: preview → tweak → preview → save (or discard)
- Saving results is a separate, explicit gesture from saving the spec

This is the key distinction from the LGCI Plan builder, where a plan is an imperative,
single-run document.

## Lifecycle model

```
[User query / Plan Builder]
        │
        ▼
   Draft (JSON)              ── ~/egeria-reports/drafts/draft_report_<ts>_<slug>.json
        │  conversational Q&A via ReportSpecElicitor
        │  canvas edits via PATCH /api/reports/drafts/{draft_id}/columns
        ▼
   Catalog entry (Markdown)  ── ~/egeria-reports/inbox/<spec_id>.md
        │  stays here permanently; can be previewed / edited at any time
        │  execute → writes result snapshot to outbox; spec is NOT moved
        ▼
   Result snapshot (Markdown) ── ~/egeria-reports/outbox/<spec_id>_executed_<ts>.md
        │  each run produces a new timestamped snapshot
        ▼
   Trash (Markdown)          ── ~/egeria-reports/trash/   (soft-delete, restorable)
   Versions (Markdown)       ── ~/egeria-reports/versions/ (auto-saved before each overwrite)
```

### Key rules

- Specs **never leave inbox on execute**. `move_to_outbox` writes a new snapshot; it does
  not unlink the source file.
- `retry` re-runs by stripping the `_executed_<ts>` suffix and calling `execute()` on the
  base spec in inbox.
- `recover` confirms the spec is in the catalog (it always is, unless explicitly deleted).
- Drafts are separate from the catalog. A draft becomes a catalog entry only after
  `_generate_report_spec` is called (the `elicit_columns → refine` transition).

```

### Three parameter categories

| Category | UX treatment | Part of spec identity? |
|---|---|---|
| **Content filters** | Front and centre; run modal pre-fills these | Yes — change them, get different data |
| **Shape defaults** | Collapsible "Report Configuration" section | Yes — change them, get different layout |
| **Performance hints** | "Advanced / Execution Settings" panel | No — operational tuning only |

`graph_query_depth` straddles shape and performance: it affects both the data returned
(shape) and query cost (performance).  It lives in `shape_defaults`.

## Markdown format (catalog entry)

The markdown file is both the serialization format and the editable representation a user
can open in an editor.  It follows Dr.Egeria `## Verb Object` / `### Attribute` conventions
so the `UniversalExtractor` can parse it.

```markdown
# <Heading>

## Create Report Spec
### Target Type
<target_type>

### Heading
<heading>

### Description
<description>

### Action Function
ClientClass.method

### Required Params
search_string

### Content Filters
search_string=*
status_filter=ACTIVE

### Shape Defaults
sort_field=display_name
sort_order=ASC
graph_query_depth=0

### Performance Hints
page_size=100
start_from=0

## Create Column
### Name
Display Name
### Key
display_name

## Create Column
### Name
GUID
### Key
guid
### Format
True
```

Parser behaviour:
- `Content Filters`, `Shape Defaults`, `Performance Hints` values are key=value blocks
  parsed by `_parse_spec_params` and merged into `ActionParameter.spec_params` at parse time.
- `Required Params` is a comma-separated list of parameter names the user must supply at
  run time (e.g., the search string in the run modal).
- `Spec Params` (legacy) is also merged into `spec_params` for backward compatibility.

## Component map

| Component | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ReportSpecElicitor` | `advisor/agents/report_spec_elicitor.py` | 3-phase conversational Q&A; markdown generator |
| `ReportSpecAgent` | `advisor/agents/report_spec_agent.py` | execute / retry / recover; calls pyegeria |
| `ReportDraftManager` | `advisor/report_draft.py` | JSON draft CRUD in `~/egeria-reports/drafts/` |
| `ReportSpecDocumentManager` | `advisor/report_spec_docs.py` | Markdown catalog CRUD; result snapshots |
| `parse_report_spec_markdown` | `advisor/report_spec_parser.py` | Markdown → FormatSet via UniversalExtractor |
| `validate_report_spec` | `advisor/report_spec_parser.py` | checks client class + method exist in pyegeria |
| `report_spec_canvas.js` | `advisor/web/static/report_spec_canvas.js` | Canvas UI for column editing |
| Web routes | `advisor/web/app.py` lines 855–1072 | REST API for all draft/doc/execute operations |

---

## Execution flow

```
POST /api/reports/docs/{doc_id}/execute
  → ReportSpecAgent.execute()
      1. load spec markdown from inbox
      2. parse_report_spec_markdown() → FormatSet
      3. register_report_spec(base_doc_id, spec)   ← registers under the SAME key exec_report_spec looks up
      4. validate_report_spec()                     ← warns; does not block
      5. merge params: spec.spec_params + custom_params
      6. pyegeria.exec_report_spec(base_doc_id, …)
      7. format output
      8. move_to_outbox()  → writes <base_doc_id>_executed_<ts>.md; spec stays in inbox
```

### Registration key alignment

`register_report_spec` uses `base_doc_id` (with `_executed_<ts>` stripped).  `exec_report_spec`
looks up the spec by the name passed to it.  Both use the same `base_doc_id`, so the lookup
always hits the in-memory registration from step 3.

## Serving curator review of survey proposals

**Added 2026-08-29.** Resource Explorer's architecture recovery is moving to a *report, then curate*
model (`resource-explorer/docs/architecture-recovery-report-then-curate.md`): RE publishes what the
analysis **proposes** — components, nesting, ports, wires, candidate blueprints — as annotations on a
`SurveyReport`, and raises an RFA asking a curator to review it and decide whether to create real
Egeria artifacts. Nothing structural is created until a human says so.

That makes a curator's review surface **a report over a SurveyReport's annotations** — which is what
this builder is for. The crude first tier of curation tooling can therefore be a Report Spec rather
than bespoke UI in RE.

### What already supports this

The pyegeria side is largely in place. `DataDiscovery` (`pyegeria/omvs/data_discovery.py`) exposes
the fetch functions a spec needs, and they are already report-spec-aware:

| Function | Note |
|---|---|
| `get_annotations_for_element(element_guid, …)` | **`report_spec` defaults to `"Annotations"`** — annotations are already a format-set target |
| `find_annotations(search_string, …)` | `report_spec` defaults to `"Referenceable"` |
| `get_annotations_by_analysis_step`, `get_annotations_by_annotation_type` | natural filters for "show me only the architecture-recovery annotations" |
| `find_analysis_reports`, `get_analysis_reports_by_name`, `get_analysis_report_by_guid` | reach the SurveyReport the RFA points at |

Their parameters map **one-to-one onto this builder's three categories** (see *Three parameter
categories*), which is the strongest sign the fit is real rather than forced:

- `search_string` / element GUID → **content_filters**
- `graph_query_depth`, `output_format` → **shape_defaults**
- `start_from`, `page_size` → **performance_hints**

`MERMAID` and `REPORT-GRAPH` are already supported output formats
(`pyegeria/view/format_set_executor.py:535,834`), alongside a `mermaid_utilities` module.

### The finding that shapes the design: pyegeria cannot draw a proposal

It is tempting to assume `output_format="MERMAID"` renders the proposed architecture. **It cannot.**
That path graphs *Egeria elements*, and a proposal's components **do not exist as elements** — that
is the entire point of report-then-curate. There is nothing for pyegeria to traverse.

So the division of labour is:

- **RE generates the Mermaid at publish time** and carries it *in the annotation*. It is a record of
  what the analysis said, captured as of that run alongside the evidence it was drawn from.
- **The report spec surfaces it.** The spec's job is to present a value the annotation already holds,
  not to derive a picture from a graph.
- **After materialisation**, pyegeria's own `MERMAID` output becomes usable, because the components
  are then real elements. That is what makes "what I approved" versus "what exists" a diff of two
  diagrams.

### What this builder needs, and does not have

1. **Survey Report and Annotation as target types.** The catalog carries 150 specs; a scan for
   survey- or annotation-shaped target types returns **none**. The three that look close —
   `Solution Blueprint`, `Solution Component`, `Solution Role` (2 each) — are auto-generated
   Dr.Egeria *create-template* attribute sets, not query reports, so they describe the materialised
   side and only after a curator has built it.
   **This is the same root cause as IB-9**: the type registry is built from the 75 `target_type`
   values that have a Dr.Egeria create template, and annotations are not authored that way, so they
   are structurally invisible to it. IB-9's live-type-listing refresh is the fix for both.
2. **A pass-through column format for embedded Mermaid.** Columns support `False | True |
   "bulleted-list"`; the Mermaid source is a text blob that must reach the output unmangled.
3. **`MERMAID` / `REPORT-GRAPH` exposed as output formats in the builder UI**, since they are
   meaningful for this spec in a way they are not for a tabular catalog report.
4. **Parameterisation by report GUID.** The RFA is per SurveyReport and carries a link to it, so the
   spec is run *against one report* — a content filter supplied at run time, which the run modal
   already pre-fills for content filters.

None of this is a change to the spec model itself. It is target-type coverage, one column format,
two output formats, and a parameter — which is the argument for using this builder rather than
building a second review surface inside RE.

## Known gaps (not yet implemented)

- **Discovery / meta-level navigation** — "databases" is ambiguous across conceptual, logical,
  and physical meta-levels.  Discovery should use RAG over `egeria_types` + `egeria_concepts`
  and present structured choices (buttons/cards), not freeform chat.
- **Master-detail parameter inheritance** — whether detail specs inherit `content_filters` /
  `shape_defaults` from the master spec or have their own three-category model is unresolved.
- **Parameter profiles** — named sets of parameters (e.g., "deep traversal", "quick lookup")
  that can be applied to any spec at run time.
- **Canvas parameter panels** — the canvas currently edits columns only.  A "Report
  Configuration" collapsible and an "Advanced" panel for the three parameter categories are
  the next UI work item.
- **Preview** — zero-cost stateless run that does NOT write a result snapshot.  Should be
  callable at any phase (draft or saved).
