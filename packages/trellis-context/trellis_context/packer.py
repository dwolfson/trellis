"""Fit resolved sources into a budget, and say exactly what was done.

Ordinary code, deliberately. Every guarantee below is unavailable if a model
decides what to include, and the guarantees are the reason this exists rather
than a prompt template:

  determinism   same spec + same inputs -> byte-identical output
  monotonicity  more budget never REMOVES content
  symmetry      grouped sections pack at equal budget and the same rung
  hard ceiling  the budget is never exceeded; it fails instead of truncating

The last one is load-bearing for the others. Silent truncation at the window
boundary defeats every promise made above it, which is why an unfittable
required section raises rather than returning a slightly-too-large context.

Budget is counted in CHARACTERS. Callers wanting token precision pass a
`measure` function; the default keeps this package free of a tokenizer heavier
than the thing it packs for.
