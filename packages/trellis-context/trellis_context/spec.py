"""What a context should contain — declared, not assembled ad hoc.

A ContextSpec is the compile target. It says which sections exist, how important
each is, how far each may be compressed, and which may be dropped. It does NOT
say what goes in them: resolvers answer that, and the packer never calls one.

Two fields carry the design's sharpest distinctions and are easy to conflate:

`mode` -- rank or gate. Purpose ranks: it orders what comes first and hides
nothing. But docs/investigation-framing-design.md §4 gates RFA emission on
Purpose, and warns that implementing that gate as a ranking floods the drawer
and fails SILENTLY. Making the distinction a typed field means it can be tested
rather than remembered.

`weight` -- budget share, and where Perspective belongs. Perspective was measured
and cannot discriminate: its twelve sets are strictly nested, so it varies the
SIZE of a result and never its content. That disqualifies it as a filter and
makes it ideal here, because nesting guarantees no perspective can be starved of
something only it needed -- there is nothing only-its. A weight cannot drop a
section; only the budget can, and then only an optional one.
