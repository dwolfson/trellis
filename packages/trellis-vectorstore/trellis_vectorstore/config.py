"""Connection configuration for PgVectorStore.

Deliberately a plain, frozen stdlib dataclass — NOT pydantic/BaseSettings —
and it never reads the environment or a YAML file itself. Resource Explorer
and Egeria Advisor each already have their own config system (RE: a single
live PgVectorConfig; EA: env settings + a YAML pgvector: block, with YAML
winning per-key — see advisor/vector_store.py's get_vector_store()) and each
keeps owning that resolution, building this dataclass as the last step
before constructing a PgVectorStore. Making this type read the environment
would make it a THIRD config surface racing EA's existing two, not a fix.
