"""trellis-vectorstore — shared pgvector-backed vector store.

Extracted from Resource Explorer's and Egeria Advisor's independently-
evolved PgVectorStore implementations, which were structurally similar
(psycopg2 + pgvector + ThreadedConnectionPool + HNSW) but had real,
deliberate behavioral differences: Postgres schema qualification (RE:
named schema; EA: unqualified/public), distance metric + score formula
(RE: cosine; EA: L2), per-collection extra scalar columns (EA only), and
search()/query_by_filter() filtering capability (EA only, RE never used
it). Every one of those differences is expressed as explicit, required
constructor configuration on the shared PgVectorStore rather than baked
into two copies of near-identical code — see docs/trellis-vectorstore-
extraction.md (in the repo root) for the full design rationale, and each
app's own thin adapter (resource_explorer/vector_store_pg.py,
advisor/vector_store_pg.py) for how each app's exact pre-extraction
behavior maps onto this shared class's configuration.
