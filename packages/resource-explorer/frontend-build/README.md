# Frontend build

Builds the bundled (non-CDN) frontend assets `index.html` loads:
`../resource_explorer/web/static/tailwind.css` and
`../resource_explorer/web/static/vendor/{marked,plotly,svg-pan-zoom}.min.js`.

Replaces `<script src="https://cdn....">`/`<link>` tags that previously
loaded these at runtime from external CDNs:

- **Tailwind** was the `cdn.tailwindcss.com` runtime JIT compiler — Tailwind
  itself documents this as unsuitable for production (it recompiles the
  stylesheet client-side on every page load).
- **marked** was pulled **unpinned** (`.../npm/marked/marked.min.js` — no
  version in the URL), meaning every page load got whatever "latest"
  happened to resolve to at that moment. A breaking upstream release could
  silently break this page with no warning and no way to pin or roll back.
- **plotly.js** and **svg-pan-zoom** were pinned by URL, but still a runtime
  dependency on an external CDN with no offline/degraded-network fallback.
- **mermaid** was pulled unpinned too, same risk as marked — but instead of
  vendoring it, diagrams now render **server-side** via the shared Kroki
  container (`POST /api/diagrams/mermaid`, a thin FastAPI proxy — see
  `resource_explorer/web/routes/diagrams.py`). The browser never loads
  mermaid.js at all now; `mermaid` was removed from this package's
  `devDependencies` and `build-vendor.js`'s copy list.

## Usage

```bash
cd frontend-build
npm install
npm run build          # builds both CSS and vendor JS
npm run build:css      # Tailwind only
npm run build:vendor   # marked/plotly/svg-pan-zoom only
```

The build outputs are checked into the repo like any other static asset —
`npm`/`node_modules` are a build-time-only dependency, not a runtime one.
`index.html` just links/scripts against the built files.

## When to re-run

- `build:css`: any time a new Tailwind utility class is added to `index.html`
  (or another file added to `tailwind.config.js`'s `content` glob) and
  doesn't already appear in the built stylesheet. Forgetting to re-run means
  the new class has no effect — this fails visually/silently at runtime, not
  at build or test time, so it's easy to miss. There is no CI check for this
  yet.
- `build:vendor`: to pick up a version bump for marked/plotly.js/
  svg-pan-zoom — bump the version in `package.json`, `npm install`, then
  `npm run build:vendor`. Versions are pinned deliberately; don't `npm
  update` these casually without checking each library's changelog first.

## A note on `<head>` order

`index.html`'s `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/tailwind.css">` MUST
come **after** the page's inline `<style>` block, not before. Several
elements combine a plain CSS class (e.g. `.modal-overlay`, which sets
`display:flex`) with Tailwind's `.hidden` utility (`display:none`) — equal
specificity, so cascade *order* decides the tie. Putting the Tailwind link
earlier flips that order and leaves every such element visible by default.
This bit us once already — see the comment beside the `<link>` tag in
`index.html`.
