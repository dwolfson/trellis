/** Tailwind build for the experimental `/next` UI — skin 1c, "dark chrome,
 * paper content".
 *
 * SEPARATE from tailwind.config.js on purpose. That build content-scans
 * index.html and emits static/tailwind.css; this one scans only static/next/
 * and emits static/next/tailwind-next.css. Two entries, two outputs, so the
 * token layer below gets proven on a real screen without one edit to the
 * ~17,900-line index.html — and so a mistake in either stylesheet cannot
 * reach the other UI.
 *
 * The token values are the contrast-audited ones from the design handoff.
 * They live HERE and nowhere else: the whole argument for a named token layer
 * is that a restyle is one file, which a second copy in a CSS custom-property
 * block would immediately undo (see docs/Architecture.md's note on what two
 * copies of one fact bought this project).
 *
 * THE KEY STRUCTURAL FACT: there are two grounds. Chrome is dark, content is
 * paper. Muted text therefore needs TWO tokens — `chrome-muted` on dark,
 * `ink-muted` on paper. A single shared muted role cannot pass contrast on
 * both, and three attempts to make one work by adjusting greys are what
 * produced this split.

        //  1. Drift. "No muted tokens on content lines" was settled in the
        //     fix round, and secondary greys crept back onto text that
        //     carries meaning — analysis ids, dates, descriptions.
        //  2. Perception. The dark chrome SURROUNDS the paper pane, and after
        //     the eye adapts to a dark surround, mid-greys on white read
        //     lighter than they measure. This pane wants to be set a step
        //     firmer than a normal light UI, not the same.

        // mono-only first pass applied the design system's constraint where
        // it does not belong: a list of rows scanned for exceptions is
        // exactly where hue earns its keep.
        //
        // Two variants per role, for the same reason `ink-muted` and
        // `chrome-muted` are two tokens. ONE value cannot hold 4.5:1 against
        // both grounds — measured, not assumed: passing on paper needs
        // luminance <= 0.159, passing on chrome needs >= 0.222, and that
        // window is empty. Any single "state-ok" would fail on one ground.
        //
        // Measured contrast, each against its own ground:
        //   state-ok        5.82:1     state-ok-on-dark    8.44:1
        //   state-warn      5.87:1     state-warn-on-dark  8.40:1

        //
        // Gold is NOT a state role. It means "needs your attention" and is
        // used for the human-input row, links and held chips. KNOWN RISK:
        // `state-warn` and gold are both warm and within 1.02:1 of each
        // other in luminance, so they separate by hue alone. Tolerable only
