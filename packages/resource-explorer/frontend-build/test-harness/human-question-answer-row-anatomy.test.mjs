/** Real-DOM regression test for ENRICHMENT-E0-ROW-ANATOMY
 *  (docs/design-notes/REPLY-DESIGNER-ENRICHMENT-STAGE-IA.md §0.3/§6 item 1,
 *  docs/design-notes/ENRICHMENT-E0-ROW-ANATOMY-IMPLEMENTED.md).
 *
 *  THE PROBLEM: a person's input to a resource lived in two stores with two
 *  different rules. Enrichment's judgements/observations
 *  (`state.enrichment` via `saveEnrichmentField`, rendered by
 *  `stages/enrichment.js`'s `fieldRowHtml`) always carried who, when, and
 *  the "⚠ review — evidence moved: X" flag. The Questions tab's answers to
 *  the catalog's human questions (`state.contextAnswers` via
 *  `saveQuestionAnswer`, rendered by `app.js`'s `rowInner`/`bodyLines`)
 *  carried only a timestamp — no author at all — entered through a
 *  blocking `window.prompt()`.
 *
 *  THE FIX: `row-anatomy.js`'s `personRowLineHtml` is the ONE function that
 *  builds the who + when + evidence-moved-flag line. `fieldRowHtml` (judge-
 *  ments/observations) and `rowInner`'s `st === 'human'` branch (question
 *  answers) both call it — this is proven below by rendering BOTH kinds of
 *  row through the REAL, unmodified functions and asserting each one's
 *  provenance line matches, character for character, what `personRowLineHtml`
 *  itself returns for the equivalent input. A test that only checked "does
 *  the text look similar" could pass with two lookalike implementations that
 *  drift apart later; matching the shared function's own output exactly is
 *  what proves they are genuinely ONE component.
 *
 *  Imports below are deliberately NOT cache-busted (contrast
 *  `dom-harness.mjs`'s `loadAppModule()`, which busts on purpose so each
 *  *.test.mjs file gets its own `state`): this test needs `app.js`,
 *  `stages/enrichment.js` and `row-anatomy.js` to resolve to the SAME module
 *  instances real `/next` uses (enrichment.js and row-anatomy.js both import
 *  `esc`/`state` from the literal specifier `/static/next/app.js` with no
 *  query string), so that setting a field on `state` here is visible inside
 *  `fieldRowHtml`.
