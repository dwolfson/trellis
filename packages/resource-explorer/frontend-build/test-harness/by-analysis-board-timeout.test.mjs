/** Real-DOM regression test for the By-analysis pane's 30-second give-up
 *  safety net (branch `re/board-summary-read-cost`,
 *  docs/design-notes/BOARD-SUMMARY-READ-COST-IMPLEMENTED.md).
 *
 *  THE GAP THIS CLOSES: that branch's own writeup flagged its 30s safety
 *  net -- `BY_ANALYSIS_BOARD_TIMEOUT_MS`, the `'timeout'` board state, and
 *  the manual `retryBoard()` trigger -- as verified only by STATIC SOURCE-
 *  TEXT assertions (`TestGiveUpAfter30SecondsSafetyNet` in
 *  `tests/test_next_by_analysis_progressive_and_graph.py`): "does the
 *  timer get armed/cleared near the right lines", never "does a real
 *  render actually show the timeout copy after 30s, and does clicking the
 *  retry button actually re-fetch." Design ruled (2026-09-28, PR #346's
 *  "every /next fix from here on adds its regression to the harness" rule)
 *  that this needs the real render harness, since only a rendered page
 *  shows a timing-dependent UI state transition.
 *
 *  THIS TEST drives the REAL, unmodified `loadByAnalysisPane()` (now
 *  exported -- see app.js's own comment above that export) with a stubbed
 *  `fetch`: the first request for one board's `getSurveyDashboards(...,
 *  { boardId })` read returns a promise that never settles, simulating a
 *  board whose read genuinely never comes back in time. It uses node:test's
 *  built-in fake timers (`t.mock.timers`) to advance past
 *  `BY_ANALYSIS_BOARD_TIMEOUT_MS` without a real 30-second wait, asserts the
 *  card renders the "still reading — open to load" copy, then simulates a
 *  real DOM click on the `[data-retry-board]` button the card renders and
 *  asserts that re-triggers a SECOND fetch for the same board -- exactly
 *  the mechanism `retryBoard()` implements -- which this time resolves, and
 *  the card leaves the timeout state once it does.
