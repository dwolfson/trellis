/** A real, node+jsdom render harness for `/next`'s vanilla-JS frontend.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: every JS-related test in this package before it existed
 * (grep `tests/test_next_*.py`) asserts against app.js's SOURCE TEXT --
 * "does this string appear near that string" -- never against actual
 * rendered DOM. That catches a function calling the wrong thing; it cannot
 * catch a function producing a DOM tree that, after a SECOND render pass
 * (a pane switch, a reload, a filter-then-expand), has lost state a first
 * render pass had. Two real bugs shipped this class of defect in one week
 * (2026-09-27/28) -- the engine-note-persistence bug (a transient DOM
 * append wiped by the next full-pane re-render) and the Schema Inventory
 * filter-then-expand bug (a column row's own visibility flag not surviving
 * its ancestor table's re-filter) -- and no source-text test could have
 * caught either, because both are about what the DOM looks like AFTER a
 * second render, not about what the source says once. See
 * docs/design-notes/NEXT-RENDER-HARNESS-IMPLEMENTED.md.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LOADS: the REAL `app.js`, unmodified except that three of its
 * previously-module-private render functions (`surveyRowHtml`, `tableHtml`,
 * `schemaTreeHtml`, `filterSchemaTree`) now carry an `export` keyword so a
 * test can call them directly -- no logic changed, only visibility, the
 * same pattern app.js already uses for `readEnvelope`/`esc`/`$` and the
 * rest of its 30-plus other exports. app.js is imported as its REAL ES
 * module graph (worklist.js, format.js, glyphs.js, envelope.js, re-api.js,
 * the stages/* and admin/* modules it pulls in) via the loader hook in
 * `static-loader.mjs`, which resolves its root-relative `/static/...`
 * specifiers to the real files under `resource_explorer/web/static/` --
 * NOT a copy, NOT a re-typed fixture.
 *
 * WHAT IS STUBBED, and why it's safe to stub: app.js's own module top level
 * runs exactly two side-effecting statements (the tail of the file) --
 * `document.getElementById('login-dismiss-btn')?.addEventListener(...)`
 * and `Auth.init(start)`. `Auth` is a global (loaded via a classic
 * `<script>` tag in index.html, not an ES import -- see app.js's own
 * comments), so importing app.js under node throws `ReferenceError: Auth
 * is not defined` unless something defines it first. The stub's `init`
 * intentionally does NOT invoke the callback it's given: `start()` is
 * app.js's full page bootstrap (a dozen parallel network fetches against
 * the real API) and this harness has no server to fetch from, nor any
 * need for one -- the two regression tests below call specific exported
 * render functions directly with fixture data, never the bootstrap path.
 * `fetch` is stubbed to reject loudly (`_UNSTUBBED_FETCH`) rather than
 * silently returning nothing, so a test that accidentally exercises a
 * network path fails with a clear message instead of hanging or reading
 * `undefined`.
