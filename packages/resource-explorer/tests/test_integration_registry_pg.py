"""The registry, against real Postgres — the divergences the FK pragma can't close.

Why this tier exists. Production runs the registry on Postgres; every other
registry test runs it on SQLite. That made SQLite a strictly *weaker* mirror of
production: a write SQLite accepts and Postgres rejects passes the whole suite
and fails live. Three incidents on record, all the same shape —

  * `remove()` never deleted five child tables; invisible on SQLite (no FK
    enforcement), a hard FK crash on Postgres (see registry.remove()'s comment)
  * `remove_database()` had the same deletion-order bug (its own comment)
  * 2026-08-23: three orphaned project_analysis_findings rows in the live
    Postgres for an unregistered slug, absorbed by a caller's broad
    except+log.warning so nothing surfaced

`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` (added 2026-08-23) closes the FK half on SQLite. It
cannot close the rest: Postgres has static column types where SQLite has
dynamic affinity, and stricter GROUP BY rules. Those need real Postgres, which
is what this file is.

Auto-skipped when Postgres isn't reachable, same posture as every other
integration test here — the suite still runs with no external services.

    """2026-09-29 hardening: the "Resource-explorer PR/CI merge" session's
    review of this branch found that the original per-instance survey cache
    (write-invalidated only through THAT SAME instance) is safe for web
    routes — every route constructs `ProjectRegistry()` fresh per request —
    but was a real staleness risk for any LONG-LIVED holder that constructs
    ONE `ProjectRegistry` and reuses it across many iterations, the shape
    `run_queue.py`'s `QueueRunner._loop` is written in: one
    `registry = ProjectRegistry()` before `while not self._stop.is_set():`,
    intended to be threaded through `claim_and_execute_once(registry) ->
    execute_run(row, registry=registry)` for every iteration. A survey
    written by a DIFFERENT process (the web server, or a different worker)
    in between two iterations would never invalidate that one instance's
    cached copy under the old scheme.

    This drives the REAL `run_queue.claim_and_execute_once` /
    `run_queue.execute_run` call chain — not two bare `ProjectRegistry`
    instances calling `get_database_surveys` directly in isolation — with
    ONE `ProjectRegistry` constructed once and threaded through multiple
    simulated run-queue iterations, exactly the way `QueueRunner._loop`
    does, so this proves the specific bug class (a long-lived worker
    registry serving a stale survey list after another process's write) is
    closed, not just the underlying cache mechanism in the abstract.

    Honesty note, found while building this test: `QueueRunner._loop`'s own
    `registry` local is currently DEAD — its call site
    (`claim_and_execute_once(kinds=self.kinds)`) does not pass `registry=`,
    so today's worker actually builds a fresh `ProjectRegistry` per
    iteration via `claim_and_execute_once`'s `registry or ProjectRegistry()`
    default, and even a future fix to pass it through would not, by itself,
    reach `get_database_surveys` — `execute_run` calls
    `HANDLERS[kind](target, result_ref)` with no `registry` argument at all,
    so every handler (`_handle_database_analysis_run` included) constructs
    its own fresh registry regardless. Neither of those is this fix's to
    make — they are separate, out-of-scope findings, logged in
    `docs/design-notes/PER-REQUEST-SERVER-LATENCY-IMPLEMENTED.md`'s
    staleness-hardening addendum. This test still exercises the call chain
    `claim_and_execute_once`/`execute_run` genuinely support (both accept an
    explicit `registry=`) with one instance reused across iterations, which
    is the pattern the cache must be safe under whether today's wiring
    happens to reach it or a future fix completes that wiring.
