"""The question-catalog generator is no longer repo-only.

`docs/multi-resource-questions-design.md` §1.1 named five places RE hardcoded
`repo`; two of them are in `scripts/csv_to_question_catalog_yaml.py`:

  item 1  `_load_known_analysis_ids()` read only `repo_analyses`, so a
          database question naming `schema_inventory` -- a real entry in
          `database_analyses` -- got no `analysis_ids` and `kind: unknown`.
  item 2  `generate()` emitted a literal `{"repo_questions": ...}`.

The guard test (`test_question_catalog_generator_guard.py`) already pins that
the committed YAML is what the committed CSV generates. These tests pin the
behaviour that guard cannot see: what the generator does with a CSV row for a
resource type that has no authored rows in the real CSV yet, since stream 4's
database rows do not exist in this worktree.
