"""Two feedback bugs fixed together (2026-09-23), both pinned at the source
level per this suite's established convention for `/next` JS modules with no
browser test runner wired in (see test_next_chat_pane.py's own docstring and
test_fact_answer_rendering.py's `_fn` helper, reproduced here).

Bug 2 — clicking "Wrong" and then cancelling the optional-comment prompt
(`window.prompt`) left `feedback.js`'s `_sendAnswerVerdict()` returning with
NOTHING shown: the "Was this right?" bar's own design principle (stated in
`_said()`'s doc comment) is that every outcome must say what happened. A
bare `return` inside the cancel branch is exactly the failure that comment
describes.

Bug 3 — `chat.js`'s per-turn vote (icon buttons via Lucide `icon()`) and
`feedback.js`'s per-question bar (previously plain "Right/Partly/Wrong" text
links) were two independently-built controls against the identical
agree/partly/disagree vocabulary, posting to the same `/api/feedback/answer`
endpoint. Consolidated onto one shared renderer, `feedbackVotesHtml()` in
app.js, that both files import for their button markup while keeping their
own click-wiring and recording logic.
