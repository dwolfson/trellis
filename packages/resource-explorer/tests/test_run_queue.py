"""The Postgres run queue — claiming, heartbeating, fairness, reconciliation.

Two tiers, deliberately, because the interesting property cannot be tested on
SQLite. `claim_next_run` relies on `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for its "only one
claimer wins" guarantee, and SQLite has no such clause — it serialises writers
instead, which produces the same *outcome* by a different mechanism. A green
SQLite test therefore tells you nothing about the Postgres behaviour it is
standing in for, which is exactly the trap `claim_due_outbox_elements`'s own
comment records (the SQLite tests were green while the real backend raised
FeatureNotSupported). So the concurrency test is marked `requires_pgvector` and
runs against the throwaway Postgres schema.
