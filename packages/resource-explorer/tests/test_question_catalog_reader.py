"""Tests for the Question checklist catalog loader (Discovery-tier Part 3
plan — question_catalog_reader.py, backing the per-phase Questions
checklist). Mirrors test_analysis_catalog_reader.py's loading conventions
(frozen dataclass, lru_cache-backed loader, clear_cache() testing hook).

No test coverage existed for this module before this change — closing a
real gap alongside the CSV reorg/regeneration.
