"""Phase 5 — zoning private investigations, and refusing to pretend.

`docs/investigation-classification-and-zoning-design.md` §3.

The whole feature turns on one thing being true: **a user who is not the owner
must be DENIED**. Everything else — the zone name, the classification, the
status field — passes just as happily when nothing is enforced at all, because
an unrecognised governance zone is *ignored* by Egeria's security connector
rather than treated as restrictive. So these tests are written around denial and
around refusing to claim protection that has not been established.
