"""The eight steps that read a table someone else filled, and what their zero means.

Backlog item 5 of the step-outcome work: `repo_website_ingestion` adopted the
five-label vocabulary, the arch-recovery steps followed, and the file-inventory
readers were named as the obvious next ones — "the table was empty" is exactly
an `unverified` that currently reads as a confident zero.

It is not a hypothetical. `project_file_inventory` was written only by RAG
ingestion and `refresh_profile` until `repo_file_inventory` existed, and the
org-import path deliberately skips ingestion. A repo imported that way had an
empty inventory permanently, and every reader of it reported a confident
nothing, forever, without raising.

The sharpest case is `DocumentationSurveyor`: half its score comes from the
inventory, so an empty one produced "Documentation quality: Minimal" — a
verdict about a repository nobody had looked at. That test is the reason this
file exists; the rest guard the same shape in its milder forms.
