"""Gradle dependency parsing — deliberately partial, and honest about it.

Before 2026-08-31 `dependency_parser.py` read six manifest kinds and none of them
was Gradle, so Egeria — 239 `build.gradle` files — had **zero** dependency rows.
`dependency_analysis` had nothing to report and `cve_scan` could never run,
which capped `security_summary` at 7 of 8 inputs for the project this tool is
built around.

`build.gradle` is Groovy (or Kotlin) *code*, not a data format, so this reads
literal forms plus two specific, cheap-to-resolve indirections: a same-file
`ext`/`val` variable, and a `gradle/libs.versions.toml` version catalog. It
still cannot run Gradle, so a BOM/platform-managed version (the common Egeria
case) stays unresolved. That is acceptable only because of what it does with
what it cannot resolve: an unresolvable version becomes **empty**, never a
guess and never the raw variable/accessor text; internal module references are
**excluded** rather than recorded as packages that exist in no registry; and a
version that WAS resolved from a variable or a catalog carries a
`dep_version_source` that says so, distinct from `"declared"` (the manifest
wrote it there literally) — see `_dep()`'s docstring in dependency_parser.py.
That distinction is the point of this whole module: a substituted version
reused as though it were declared is a worse bug than no version at all,
because it produces a confident CVE answer about a version nobody actually
pinned.
