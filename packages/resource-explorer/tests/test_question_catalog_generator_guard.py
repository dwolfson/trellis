"""The question catalog YAML is generated from its CSV and says so in its
own header. Nothing checked it: a hand-edit to the YAML passed 144 tests
on 2026-09-12 (caught in review of a peer's branch, not by the suite). The
survey definitions have had this guard since their generator landed --
test_survey_definition_generator_guard -- and this is the same shape for
the catalog: a clean tree regenerates to byte-identical output, so a YAML
that drifts from its CSV fails here and names the fix.
