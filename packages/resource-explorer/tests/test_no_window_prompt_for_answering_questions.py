"""No `window.prompt()` anywhere in the flow for answering one of the
catalog's Human-Supplied questions (ENRICHMENT-E0-ROW-ANATOMY,
docs/design-notes/REPLY-DESIGNER-ENRICHMENT-STAGE-IA.md §0.3/§6 item 1).

Before this change, `wireHumanAnswers()` in app.js opened a blocking
`window.prompt(question, prior)` popup: one line, no author, and it froze
the rest of the page. It is replaced by an inline control on the row itself
-- the same input+save shape `stages/enrichment.js` already uses for
judgements/observations -- wired through `data-human-edit` (open),
`data-answer-save` (save) and `data-answer-cancel` (cancel).

Source-text assertion, following this codebase's established pattern for
"this bad thing must not appear in this function's source" (see e.g.
test_enrichment_save_field_entity_type.py) -- the render-harness test
(frontend-build/test-harness/human-question-answer-row-anatomy.test.mjs)
covers what actually renders; this pins that the popup call itself is gone
from the function that used to make it, not just that something else now
also works.
