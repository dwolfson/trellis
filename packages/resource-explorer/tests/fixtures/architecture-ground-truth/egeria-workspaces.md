# Ground-truth partition — egeria-workspaces

> **PRE-REGISTERED**, with provenance marked per component (see `README.md`).
> Scored **per perspective** (plan §5a, design §4.1).

**Target:** egeria-workspaces
**Checkout:** `/Users/dwolfson/localGit/egeria-v6/egeria-workspaces-fs`
**Perspective:** deployment
**Vocabulary:** SoftwareCapability subtypes (Area 0) — *not* SolutionComponentType (design §4.2)
**Written by:** dwolfson
**Written at:** 2026-08-20

> Transcribed by the assistant from the maintainer's hand-written `docs/workspaces.md`.
> **Component names, groupings and descriptions are the maintainer's**; the assistant added
> structure, types, and the perspective/vocabulary fields. Marked per component.
>
> This is the **deployment** perspective — components are named by `container_name`, which is
> what appears in `docker ps` and what the maintainer called them. Types come from the
> `SoftwareCapability` family, not the 13 `SolutionComponentType` values.
>
> The 11 optional runtime add-ons are **components, not blueprints** (§8.2b). The 3 runtime
> modes (`demo-quickstart` / `local-quickstart` / `freshstart`) are **not components at all**.

  single-page applications over Egeria data and services, JavaScript front ends with Python
  backends. MCP serves both report execution and Dr.Egeria commands. Near-superset of the
  FreshStart copy (§8.2a): 90 shared paths, 60 byte-identical, 30 divergent, 48 unique here.
