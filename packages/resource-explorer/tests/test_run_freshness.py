"""The freshness gate on user-initiated analysis runs.

Measured 2026-09-10 over the 1,207 successful runs in `activity_log`: 20.7%
happened within five minutes of an identical prior run of the same analysis on
the same repo, and ~95% of those produced no different findings — a fifth of all
runs buying nothing, at up to 110s each.

Two decisions from the project owner shape what is tested here: **skip by
default** (not warn-and-run), and **leave the scheduler alone** — gating nightly
sweeps changes what "nightly" means, which is a different decision from sparing
someone a redundant click.
