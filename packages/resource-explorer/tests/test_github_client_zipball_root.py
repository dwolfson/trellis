    review ("the cache path is covered by the new file instead," meaning
    test_source_cache.py exercises SourceCache/local_clone directly, not
    this integration seam). Writing it here surfaced a real regression,
    fixed alongside these tests: the cached path built `root / subproject_path`
    with no existence check, silently handing a caller a non-existent
    directory instead of download_zipball's ValueError.

    `zipball_root()` does `from resource_explorer.github.source_cache import
    SourceCache` as a LOCAL import inside the method, re-resolved on every
    call — patching `SourceCache` on `client.py`'s module namespace is a
    no-op, since that name never lives there. It must be patched where the
    class actually lives, `source_cache.SourceCache`, which the local import
    reads at call time.

    A real zip file (not a mock) so extraction genuinely exercises
    zipfile.ZipFile, matching how the two are wired in production.
