"""A survey step that emits BOTH a passing check and a failing one in the
same run() must not have the passing check's summary end up under a
RequestForAction label in the activity log.

Real bug, found 2026-09-01 investigating Dan's report ("I don't know what
they mean... they all seem to be SecurityHygieneCheck 3... [and there seem
to be duplicates]"). Two of ten items in the RFA drawer read "Security
policy file present" — a PASS, from SecurityHygieneSurveyor's own
ClassificationAnnotation — but were typed "RequestForAction" and so matched
GET /api/activity/rfas' substring filter.

The bug was not in the surveyor (security_hygiene.py correctly emits
ClassificationAnnotation for a pass, RequestForActionAnnotation only for a
gap — verified by reading it). It was in SurveyOrchestrator.run()'s
self-logging: `by_step` grouped every annotation from one step by STEP NAME
ALONE, so a step producing several annotations (a pass here, a gap there)
collapsed into one dict. `summary` kept the FIRST annotation seen
(first-wins); `annotation_type` kept being overwritten to the LAST one seen
(last-wins) — two different "which one won" rules on the same group, which
is exactly the shape that let a passing summary wear a failing label.

This is also Problem 2 from the same investigation: FileSizeSurveyor's
"Repository disk footprint: ..." (a ResourceMeasureAnnotation, a
measurement, not a request) surfaced in the RFA drawer for the identical
reason — a large-file RequestForActionAnnotation from the SAME step
(FileSizeAnalysis) overwrote the group's annotation_type after the
measurement's summary had already been captured. One root cause, two
symptoms — confirmed here rather than assumed.
