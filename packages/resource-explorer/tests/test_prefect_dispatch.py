"""Prefect dispatch: which engine runs a step, and whether the API path works.

Two faults, neither of which produced an error.

**The API path had never executed.** run_prefect_step began with
`asyncio.get_running_loop()`, while a redundant `import asyncio` further down the
same function turned `asyncio` into a closure cell (the lambda captures it), so
that first line did a LOAD_DEREF on a cell nothing had stored and raised
UnboundLocalError. The broad `except` read it as "API unreachable", logged a
warning, and ran the flow locally. Every Prefect step has always run in-process
and _run_prefect_step_api was dead code — while the log said only that dispatch
had "failed", which is exactly what a genuinely unreachable server looks like.

**A global flag overrode a per-step declaration.** `prefect.enabled` re-routed
every step that had explicitly declared executes_at="resource-explorer".
executes_at is documented as naming the execution engine, and as open-ended so
engines can be chosen per step; a flag that overrules it removes the only way to
say "run this one here" and makes executes_at="prefect" redundant. Routing RE's
own steps through Prefect is a legitimate deployment choice, so it keeps working
— it just has to be asked for by name.

**A third fault, found once the first two were fixed and the API path could
finally run for real (2026-08-26, verified live against a local `prefect
server` + worker — deploy required switching `.deploy()` to `.from_source()`,
since a bare `work_pool_name` assumes remote/image-based storage rather than a
local `process` pool).** `_run_prefect_step_api` fetched the completed flow
run's result via `client.resolve_value(state.data)` — that method doesn't
exist on `PrefectClient` in Prefect 3.x, so every completed API-dispatched run
raised `AttributeError`, was caught by the same broad `except`, and fell
through to a **second, duplicate local execution** — the step's real work had
already happened once via the worker, then happened again via the fallback,
silently. Fixed to `state.result(raise_on_failure=True)`, the real 3.x API —
which then raised `MissingResult` until `re_survey_flow` also declared
`persist_result=True` (3.x doesn't persist flow results by default, and a
`State` fetched back via `read_flow_run` from a different process than the one
that ran the flow has no in-memory result to fall back to)."""
