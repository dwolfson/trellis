"""Live-write harness for the `live_egeria_writes` pytest tier.

    ==========================================================================
    COORDINATION NOTICE — READ BEFORE USING ANY FIXTURE IN THIS MODULE
    ==========================================================================
    Every fixture here performs REAL writes (catalogue, then delete) against
    the shared dev Egeria platform that other Claude Code sessions on this
    machine also use for real work. Per this project's `coordinate-shared-
    writes` discipline (see the skill of that name, and
    `docs/design-notes/PLAN-EXECUTION-MODES-VERIFICATION.md` phase 4), running
    any test that pulls in `live_egeria_write_target` (or any other fixture
    below) is NOT something you get to do unilaterally, even though the
    elements created are thrown away within the same test:

      1. Before the FIRST run in a session, call ListAgents, message every
         live peer describing exactly what will be catalogued and deleted
         and why concurrent writes are unsafe (or why they're safe — dedup by
         a session-unique qualified-name prefix is the argument here, see
         below), and wait for explicit clearance from everyone who can write.
      2. A "looks idle" read of ListAgents is not consent. Silence is not
         consent.
      3. Run the write exactly once per coordination round. This tier is not
         meant to be looped for local iteration — if a test using it fails,
         fix it by reasoning about the failure, not by re-running until it
         passes (this project's shared-write discipline again: verify
         independently, never re-run to check).

    This is why `live_egeria_writes` is a SEPARATE, more restrictive marker
    than `requires_egeria` (see conftest.py's `pytest_collection_modifyitems`
    and the design note PHASE-4-LIVE-HARNESS-IMPLEMENTED.md for the reasoning
    in full). `requires_egeria` only certifies that a platform happens to be
    reachable — a read-only-safe, always-on-when-possible check. Writing to
    dev Egeria, even throwaway writes, is a bigger commitment than "Egeria
    happens to be up" and needs a *deliberate* second gate: the
    `--live-egeria-writes` CLI flag, mirroring the existing `--corpus` /
    `skip_corpus` precedent in conftest.py. A plain `pytest tests/` run must
    never exercise this tier just because Egeria happens to be reachable at
    that moment — that would turn an ordinary developer laptop run into an
    unannounced shared write.

Collision safety
-----------------
Every element this module catalogues carries a qualified-name prefix of
``test-fixture-phase4-<uuid4 hex>-`` — unique per fixture invocation, not just
per test session — so two sessions running this tier at the same moment
(against advice above, or after both got clearance for genuinely disjoint
work) cannot collide on a shared name the way `AutomatedCuration.
create_*_element_from_template` would if two callers raced on the same
`postgres_server`/`postgres_database`/`folder_name` value. It does not make
concurrent runs *safe* by itself — the coordination step above is still
mandatory — it only removes "the two runs picked the same name" as a
possible failure mode, in the same spirit as the note in
`reference_egeria_dedup_and_link_patterns.md` about qualifiedName collisions.

    this fixture without collection ever having applied the marker skip
