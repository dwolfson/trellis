"""A human-question answer, author-stamped — PATCH /api/context/{type}/{slug}/answer.

ENRICHMENT-E0-ROW-ANATOMY (docs/design-notes/REPLY-DESIGNER-ENRICHMENT-
STAGE-IA.md §0.3/§6 item 1): before this route existed, a human answer to one
of the catalog's Human-Supplied questions was saved by the client doing its
own read-modify-write against the whole context document, and the record it
built carried only a timestamp — no author at all, breaking the reply's own
stated rule that "a human-supplied answer carries who and when." This mirrors
`test_enrichment_fields.py`'s tests for `save_field` (the same rule already
enforced for enrichment judgements/observations): the author is stamped by
the server from the signed-in identity, never taken from the client, and an
anonymous write is refused rather than recorded as nobody's.
