"""Every Tailwind class literal used in a `class="..."` attribute inside
resource_explorer/web/static/next/**/*.js must exist somewhere in the
compiled next/tailwind-next.css (or, for the handful of things a utility
class is the wrong tool for, in index.html's own inline <style> block -- see
its opening comment). An uncompiled/typo'd class name otherwise renders as
literally nothing, silently, with no error and no visual cue -- exactly the
bug this file exists to catch. See
TAILWIND-NEXT-FRESHNESS-CHECK-IMPLEMENTED.md for the full
design writeup, including why this check is independent of (not a
replacement for) test_tailwind_next_freshness.py's rebuild-and-diff check.

## How extraction mirrors Tailwind's own content scanning

tailwind-next.config.js's `content` glob has no custom `extract` function, so
Tailwind's own default scanner is a broad, syntax-unaware regex over the raw
file text: it does not parse JS, it just finds quote/backtick/whitespace/
`${`/`}`-delimited candidate tokens. That is *why* a conditional class built
with a template-literal ternary like
`` `${isOpen ? 'border-accent bg-chrome-line/20' : 'border-chrome-line'}` ``
compiles correctly -- Tailwind sees the two complete literal strings inside
the ternary branches, not the ternary itself.

This check mirrors that: it does not parse the ternary as JS, it walks the
`${...}` interpolation looking for fragments, between the unquoted `?`/`:`
separators, that are themselves *wholly* a single quoted string literal --
i.e. the same "collect complete literal strings, ignore everything else"
rule Tailwind's own scanner effectively applies. A fragment that mixes code
and a literal (`f.label === 'worthy' ? ...`, where `'worthy'` is a
comparison operand, not a class) is deliberately NOT treated as a candidate,
because the literal there is not in value position -- collecting it would be
exactly the false-positive Tailwind's own scanner also avoids by not knowing
JS syntax at all (it has no notion of "comparison" vs "result" either; it
simply never sees `'worthy'` as a value because it isn't followed by
whitespace/quote boundaries that make it a stand-alone class-list string in
the surrounding markup -- our ternary-aware split gets the same answer by a
different, JS-aware route).

## Known, documented gaps (false negatives, by design)

**Fully dynamic interpolations with no literal branch at all** -- e.g.
`${cls}`, `${mutedCls}`, `${hoverCls[tone]}`, `${chip(state.scope === id)}`
-- are invisible to this check, exactly as they are invisible to Tailwind's
own build (neither can resolve a bare identifier or function call to a
string at scan time; Tailwind CLI's own documented guidance is "never
construct class names dynamically" for precisely this reason). These are
silently skipped rather than guessed at -- see `EXCLUDED_DYNAMIC_COUNT`
below, which pins the current count so a large unexplained jump (someone
introducing a lot of new dynamic-only class construction) is visible in a
diff even though no individual name can be checked.
