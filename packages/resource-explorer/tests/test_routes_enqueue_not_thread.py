"""Routes enqueue; they do not spawn threads.

The one property step 2b's whole point rests on, and the one a later change is
most likely to undo by accident — spawning a thread "just for this one route"
looks local and harmless, and would put a survey back inside a web process that
the plan's `web` role says must never outlive a request.

Asserted three ways, because each catches a different mistake:

* **Structurally**, that no route module spawns a thread for these kinds. A
  behavioural test cannot see a thread that was started and immediately
  finished.
* **Behaviourally**, that hitting the route leaves a `queued` row.
* **By absence**, that nothing ran — the run's own workflow function is
  patched and asserted uncalled, so a route that both enqueued AND executed
  would fail rather than look right.
