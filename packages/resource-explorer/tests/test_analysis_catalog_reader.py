    # recovery is an analysis step and belongs there"), so it is gone from
    # this set — not because the earlier ruling was wrong to record, but

    # README, sibling-repo listing), and letting an empty resource declaration
    # hide a real fetch would turn rule 17's signature into a formality. The
    # rule's actual test is "cheap enough to gate the expensive tiers", which a

        The default protects the second case. An analysis that acquires a
        resource is queued for a STRUCTURAL reason, and saying so is what stops
        a later reader assuming it was simply overlooked — the same distinction
        `run_scope`/`partial` exist to make elsewhere in this codebase.

        Raised by trellis-chat-panel-1f while verifying the merge, who noticed
        architecture_recovery reached `queued` by falling through.
