"""The Assessment survey for repositories includes the four compliance steps.

Owner decision 2026-10-02 (the analysis-gaps plan for repos and databases, slice R2):
`repo_secret_scan`, `repo_telemetry_scan`, `repo_contribution_provenance` and
`repo_sla_content` sat only in the Compliance and Full surveys, so a repository
that was *assessed* never got them (the 2026-09-11 audit found them run on 2, 1,
1 and 1 of the 14 kept repositories). They are now members of
RepoAssessmentSurvey as well. Compliance and Full keep them: steps are shared,
never moved.

This file pins four things:

* the membership and ORDER of the Assessment definition, in the CSV that is its
  source and in the generated Dr.Egeria document that Egeria is authored from;
* every prerequisite the four declare is satisfied by an earlier step in the
  same definition;
* no other survey lost a step;
* what happens when the four cannot run (no inventory, no GitHub access): the
  step is reported as skipped or as an error, never as a clean zero.
