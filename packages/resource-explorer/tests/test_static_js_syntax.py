"""Syntax guard for the no-build static JS under `web/static/`.

That tree (`re-api.js`, `next/app.js`, `next/stages/*.js`, `next/admin/*.js`,
...) ships straight to the browser with no bundler and no compile step. The
other JS-facing tests in this suite (`test_next_prerequisite_proposal_ui.py`,
`test_re_api_entity_type_threading.py`, `test_fact_answer_rendering.py`)
read that source as TEXT and assert on substrings -- a good technique for
pinning behaviour, but blind to syntax. On 2026-09-24 a malformed JSDoc block
in `re-api.js` (a `*/` followed by more ` * ` continuation lines, no longer
inside a comment) left the module unparseable, and the entire text-substring
suite still passed green -- the break would only have shown up as a blank
page in the browser.

This test runs `node --check` (via stdin, `--input-type=module`) over each
shipped `.js` file and fails if any of them fail to parse. It excludes
`static/vendor/` -- third-party, minified, not ours to pin -- and treats
every remaining file as an ES module: `next/**/*.js` are loaded with
`<script type="module">` in `next/index.html`, and the one plain-script file
(`auth.js`, loaded as a classic script) still parses cleanly under module
mode, since nothing in it uses syntax module mode forbids.

**This is a local-developer guard, not CI coverage.** `.github/workflows/
resource-explorer.yml` has no Node setup step, so `node` is not on PATH
there -- the workflow only ever hits the skip branch below. Catching this
class of bug depends on running the suite locally with a Node install
present.
