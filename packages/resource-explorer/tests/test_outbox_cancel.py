"""Cancelling queued outbox work, safely.

Written after 2026-09-01, when a pre-fix Committed Secrets run queued ~48,500
Egeria writes and there was no supported way to stop them.
`purge_outbox_completed()` handles 'done' rows only — deliberately, since
"failed/pending rows are live work" — so cancelling meant a hand-written
DELETE against live data.

The reason `preview_outbox_cancel` exists as its own method rather than as
advice: the first statement written by hand matched **39,603 of 48,113** rows,
because two buggy runs were queued rather than one. Printing the count first
is the only reason 8,510 bogus annotations were not left to publish on the
next restart.
