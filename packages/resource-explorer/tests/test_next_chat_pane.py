"""Chat's own /next module (PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md item 9): pinning the
extraction out of app.js into next/chat.js, the rail-keeps-provenance-only /
pane-holds-the-answer placement move (SPEC-THE-STAGE-PAGE.md's rule, applied
per ASSESSMENT-CHAT.md §2), and the three follow-ups from that assessment's
§3 — opening the compile, using the stream, and joining the vote to the gaps
loop item 8 built.

No browser verification of a signed-in session happened for this file — see
docs/design-notes/ITEM-9-CHAT-IMPLEMENTED.md for what was and was not
checked live. These tests grep/slice function bodies out of the source, the
established pattern for /next JS modules without a browser — see
test_next_understanding_pane.py and test_next_admin_pane.py's identical
`_app()`-style helpers, reproduced here for chat.js and app.js together.
