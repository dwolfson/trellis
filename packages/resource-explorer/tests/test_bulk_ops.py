"""Bulk republish and deletion over many resources.

An Egeria reset makes every cataloged resource stale at once, so the
per-resource resolve means twenty clicks for one event. These are the same
operations over a list — and the interesting part is what they refuse to do.

Two properties are load-bearing and tested here rather than assumed:

  * **An explicit target list, never a derived one.** A sweep result and a work
    list are different things. `egeria-recheck` reports what it found at that
    moment; deriving "everything stale" inside a bulk delete would act on a list
    nobody read.
  * **Per-item isolation.** One resource failing must not abandon the other
    nineteen. This codebase already shipped a batch importer that stopped at its
    first repo and reported nothing (github/org_importer.py), and the failure was
    invisible because the thread simply died.
