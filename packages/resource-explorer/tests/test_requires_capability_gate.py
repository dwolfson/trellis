"""`requires_capability` as one axis beside cost tier, in the same gate.

`REPLY-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` §7.1, replying to
`ASK-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` (#251):

    Build it as one axis beside cost tier in the same gate, not as a separate
    flow: a step declares `fetch_cost`, `compute_cost` and
    `requires_capability`, and the launcher shows one combined reason.

What could go wrong, and what each group below pins shut:

  * the axis turns into a SECOND gate — two proposals, two prompts, a reader
    left to reconcile "this costs a download" with "this cannot see 23 of
    your tables". `test_both_axes...` is the one that fails if that happens;
  * it blocks on an absence — a database nobody ever probed reads as a
    database whose credential can do nothing, which is exactly the
    absence-as-answer failure the credential work exists to close, pointing
    the other way;
  * the four values get treated as a ladder, so a `pg_monitor` role with no
    grants "satisfies read";
  * accepting "run it anyway" re-resolves, hits the same shortfall and skips
    the step the user just approved — an accept button that does nothing;
  * it leaks onto repo/filesystem steps, which have no credential model.

The declaration tests at the bottom are deliberately about the AUDIT rather
than about taste: `DATABASE-STEP-CAPABILITY-AUDIT.md` traced every step to
its SQL, and a change to one of these values should have to argue with that
document rather than slip through.
