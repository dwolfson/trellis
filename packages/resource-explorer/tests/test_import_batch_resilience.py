"""A batch import must not stop at the first repo.

Observed 2026-08-21: a user selected many repos, the first (milvus) was
registered, and the rest silently were not. The evidence was the absence of
evidence — milvus appeared in `projects` with no activity entry, and no "batch
complete" summary, which every batch writes unconditionally.

The cause was structural, not incidental. `log_scout` sat *inside* the same try
as `import_repo`, so a registry write failure ("server closed the connection
unexpectedly" — the known Egeria-side issue) was caught by the except handler,
which called `log_scout` again. That second call raised too, escaped the loop,
and killed the daemon thread. Nothing was left to report it: a daemon thread's
exception goes nowhere.

Two separate wrongs, both fixed here:
  * The audit trail was allowed to end the work it describes.
  * A logging failure was counted and reported as an *import* failure, for a
    repo that had actually been registered.
