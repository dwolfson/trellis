"""The whole Survey Definition, sequenced by Prefect rather than by RE.

These run the real flow in-process — Prefect 3 starts an ephemeral server, so
no standing deployment is needed and the ordering being asserted is Prefect's
own, not a simulation of it.

`re_survey_flow` (the older one) runs ONE step. With only a per-step entry
point the step order had nowhere to live but RE's `while` loop, which is how
RE ended up being the sequencer.
