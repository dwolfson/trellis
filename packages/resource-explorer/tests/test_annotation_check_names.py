"""Every annotation carries a stable identity, and no two collide.

The qualifiedName an annotation publishes under is built from `check_name`
(+ `item_key`). Two failures are possible and neither announces itself:

- **A missing check_name** falls back to the enumeration index, which is not
  stable across runs — the defect the whole scheme exists to remove. A new
  surveyor added without one silently rejoins the old behaviour.
- **A colliding qualifiedName** loses an element on publish: Egeria rejects
  the duplicate, apply_element adopts the existing GUID, and the run reports
  success having written one where two were produced.

`assert_unique_qualified_names` catches the second at publish time, but that
is a broken publish. These tests catch both at edit time.
