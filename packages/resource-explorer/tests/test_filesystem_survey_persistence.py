"""A filesystem survey is evidence whether or not Egeria hears about it.

`_run_filesystem_inventory` used to walk the filesystem, return the inventory,
and persist nothing. The only `add_filesystem_survey` call on the Survey
Definition path lived inside `_publish_step_annotations`, which raises when the
filesystem has no Egeria asset — and `SurveyDefinitionExecutor` catches that
into `errors`. So a run that did real work discarded it, left
`last_surveyed_at` untouched, and gave the next run nothing to compare against.

The local route has always persisted unconditionally, and the database adapter
does the same inside `DatabaseSurveyor.survey()`. Filesystem was the only path
where the write was conditional on cataloguing succeeding.
