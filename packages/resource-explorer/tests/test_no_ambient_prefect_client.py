"""Ratchet test against a bare `get_client(` call anywhere in
`resource_explorer` — the shape behind the 2026-09-28 silent-dispatch bug.

`prefect.client.get_client()` (the installed Prefect version, 3.8.1) takes
no `api=` argument. It resolves the server address itself, from
`PREFECT_API_URL.value()` — Prefect's own settings machinery, read fresh at
call time from whatever the process environment/settings context looks like
at that moment, which is NOT the same thing as RE's own `config.prefect.
api_url` (`resource_explorer/config.py`). A live web-server process that had
`PREFECT_API_URL` correctly set had `get_client()` still raise `ValueError:
No Prefect API URL provided`, because nothing in that process had ever
pointed Prefect's OWN settings resolution at RE's configured URL.

`run_prefect_step`'s existing broad `except Exception` (see
`prefect_adapter.py`, and `tests/test_no_silent_success.py` for the sibling
bug this same function already carries) caught that `ValueError` exactly
like a genuinely unreachable server and fell back to local execution — while
`step_runs.executor` had already been written as `'prefect'`, entered before
dispatch even attempted. Every `step_runs` row labelled `executor='prefect'`
from an affected process was therefore not trustworthy evidence that
anything had run through Prefect at all — see
`docs/design-notes/PREFECT-DISPATCH-HONESTY-IMPLEMENTED.md`.

The fix: every module that needs a Prefect client goes through
`resource_explorer.surveyors.prefect_adapter.re_prefect_client()`, which
constructs `PrefectClient(config.prefect.api_url)` directly — `PrefectClient`
(unlike the `get_client()` convenience wrapper) takes `api` as a required
positional argument and does no ambient-settings resolution of its own.

This test walks `resource_explorer` with `ast` and fails if ANY call to a
function or attribute named `get_client` appears outside
`prefect_adapter.py`'s own `re_prefect_client()` definition — the one place
that name is allowed to appear as a live call (it doesn't; `re_prefect_client`
calls `PrefectClient(...)` directly, never `get_client()` — but the guard
stays function-scoped rather than file-scoped so a future re-introduction of
`get_client()` inside that same file, in a different function, still fails
loudly instead of hiding behind an established exemption).

No baseline file: unlike `test_no_silent_success.py`'s 112 pre-existing
sites, this codebase has zero legitimate call sites for `get_client(` today
— the whole point of `re_prefect_client()` is that nothing should ever call
it directly. A hard zero-tolerance assertion, not a ratchet with debt to
grandfather in.
