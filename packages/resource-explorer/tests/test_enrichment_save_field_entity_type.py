"""stages/enrichment.js's three `saveEnrichmentField` call sites used to omit
the entity type entirely, so they always hit `saveEnrichmentField`'s (pre-fix)
hardcoded `/api/context/repo/{slug}/field` -- a database/filesystem
Enrichment save landed silently in the repo context bucket under that slug,
not the resource's own bucket. See test_re_api_entity_type_threading.py for
the `saveEnrichmentField` definition-level fix; this file pins that all three
call sites in enrichment.js actually pass the resource's real entity type.
