"""The finding row is DERIVED from the annotation, not typed again beside it.

Written for the security_hygiene migration (2026-09-02), the first surveyor
moved onto `check_name`/`label`. The bug these pin is not hypothetical: before
the migration the SECURITY.md check emitted an annotation at confidence=90 and
stored a finding that omitted confidence, so project_analysis_findings
defaulted it to 100. Same check, same run, two stores, two numbers, and
nothing anywhere raised — which is why it survived.

Each test below was run against the pre-migration surveyor and observed to
fail, so a green result here means the derivation holds rather than that the
check did not fire.
