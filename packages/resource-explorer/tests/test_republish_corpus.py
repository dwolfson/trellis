"""Guards for the corpus republish script, written from the 2026-09-02 failure.

Two things went wrong that night and neither was subtle — they were simply not
looked for. The batch recorded a repo with 57 of 125 annotations failed as a
success, because publish() returned an asset GUID. And it kept running while
the Egeria platform climbed to 91% of its memory cap and stopped serving.
