"""The sweep must agree with the publisher about whether an asset exists.

Measured 2026-08-26 against a live, healthy catalog: get_asset_by_guid raised
PyegeriaNotFoundException/400 for GUIDs that plainly existed, so the sweep
declared ALL 23 cached GUIDs stale while find_asset_guid returned those exact
GUIDs for the same repos. `--apply` on that verdict would have cleared every
valid registration in the catalog, along with its survey records and -- once
publish claims were added to the clearing -- its publish history too.

publisher uses is worse than having no script.
