"""Guards for configdata/check_registry.yaml and the check-granularity join
it backs (added 2026-08-24; see docs/investigation-framing-design.md).

The registry is hand-maintained but describes runtime behaviour, so the
failure mode to design against is silent drift: a surveyor gains or renames a
check, the registry doesn't, and every question referencing it quietly stops
resolving. Nothing else would notice — an unresolved ref looks exactly like a
question nobody has tagged yet.

Deliberately NOT tested here: agreement with the live Postgres registry.
`project_analysis_findings` only shows checks that have actually run on some
repo, so it can confirm the registry isn't missing anything real but can never
confirm the registry isn't stale. Re-verify that by hand with:

    SELECT kind, check_name, count(*) FROM project_analysis_findings GROUP BY 1,2
