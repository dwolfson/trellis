"""Source-level regression tests for /next's §17.1 prerequisite-proposal UI.

`docs/Backlog.md` logged the gap this closes: classic (index.html) has a
working "answering this needs X first — estimated Ns; run it?" prompt wired
to `/api/prerequisites/plan` and `/api/prerequisites/run`
(`resource_explorer/web/routes/prerequisites.py`), and `/next` (the
intent-based UI under `resource_explorer/web/static/next/`) had no
equivalent — a `/next` user whose run crossed a cost tier got nothing.

No JS test runner is wired into this suite (see test_re_api_entity_type_
threading.py's own note), so this pins the fix at the source level, the same
technique used there and in test_fact_answer_rendering.py for index.html:
read the real shipped source, extract the function/branch under test, and
assert on what it actually does — not a re-implementation of it in Python
that could drift from the JS without either failing.

Design judgment call this pins (see this branch's PR description for the
full reasoning): `/next` calls `POST /api/prerequisites/plan` PROACTIVELY,
before dispatching a run, rather than reading a `proposal` embedded in a
results payload the way classic's `_renderPrerequisiteProposal` does.
`prerequisite_resolver.Resolution.as_plan()`'s own docstring says `/plan` has
"no live consumer today; the classic UI reads `proposal.as_dict()`
directly" — so `/next` becomes `/plan`'s first live consumer, using the
endpoint's own documented purpose ("asks what a step would need WITHOUT
running anything") exactly as designed, rather than depending on whichever
analysis results readers happen to attach `_status.proposal` to their output
(confirmed NOT to be uniformly wired for the repo `SurveyOrchestrator` skip
path at the time of this change — the `step_skipped`/`prerequisite_auto_run`
annotations it writes are not read back by any results reader today).
