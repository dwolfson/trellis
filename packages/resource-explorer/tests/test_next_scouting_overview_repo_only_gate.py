"""Source-level regression test for `loadPane`'s `getScoutingOverview` call
(`resource_explorer/web/static/next/app.js`) — it must be gated on
`state.resourceType === 'repo'`, since `/api/projects/{slug}/scouting-overview`
is a repo-only endpoint (docs/Backlog.md, "/next probes scouting-overview for
database slugs and always gets a 404").

Before this fix, `/next` called `getScoutingOverview(slug)` on every page load
regardless of resource type, 404ing every time for a database or filesystem
slug — the same class of bug as the earlier 'db'/'database' resourceType
mismatch: a call written against one resource type and never gated for the
others.

No JS test runner is wired into this suite for `loadPane` specifically (it is
not exported, and is too large/DOM-entangled to run standalone under node —
see `test_next_resource_header_publish_note.py`'s own note on the same
limitation for a different function), so this pins the fix at the source
level, following that file's established pattern.
