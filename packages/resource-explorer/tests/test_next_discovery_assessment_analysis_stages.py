"""Item 11 (PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md): Discovery, Assessment and Analysis as
real, built stages in /next.

The mechanism these three stages need already existed for Scouting/
Enrichment/Curate before this item: the generic Questions-checklist engine
in `loadPane()` (app.js), parameterised by `phase`. This item's whole change
is (1) flipping `built: true` for the three, (2) adding one small honest
note about what Analysis's classic Sub-Resources feature does not have a
/next equivalent for, and (3) documentation-only staleness fixes to
Automate's comment about what a card-less Assessment/Analysis stage means.

No browser verification of a signed-in session happened for this file — see
docs/design-notes/ITEM-11-DISCOVERY-ASSESSMENT-ANALYSIS-IMPLEMENTED.md for
what was and was not checked live. These tests grep/slice function bodies
out of the concatenated source, the established pattern for /next JS
modules without a browser -- see test_next_curate_pane.py,
test_next_understanding_pane.py and test_next_enrichment_fidelity.py's
`_app()` helper, reproduced identically here.
