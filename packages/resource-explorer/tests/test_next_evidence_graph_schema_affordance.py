"""The Relationship Graph Evidence-rail block's "open one schema" zoom level
(`data-act="evidence-graphviz-schema"`, added in `re/relationship-graph-rendering`,
merged as PR #339) rendered as a bare `<select>` with no visual affordance that
it's interactive -- no border/hover/focus distinct from surrounding text, no
icon suggesting "this opens a menu". It read as inert text next to its sibling
"Schema map"/"Whole database" buttons, which ARE styled as buttons (bordered,
accent-colored, with an icon). The project owner tried it live and flagged
this.

Fix is pure CSS/markup: give the select the same button-like treatment as its
siblings (`border-accent`/`text-accent-on-dark`/hover state) plus a chevron
icon, wrapped in a relative container so the icon can sit inside the control.
`data-act` and the `<option>` list are untouched, so existing/future behavior
wiring (the `change` listener in `renderEvidenceRail`) and any option-content
assertions are unaffected.

These are source-text assertions, matching this repo's established pattern
for pure front-end JS behaviour (see test_next_sidebar_group_collapse.py,
test_next_component_review.py, test_next_rail_states.py) -- there is no
jsdom/browser harness here, so live rendering was verified manually in a
browser instead; see
docs/design-notes/RELATIONSHIP-GRAPH-SCHEMA-SELECT-AFFORDANCE-IMPLEMENTED.md.

First pass of this fix committed WITHOUT rebuilding `tailwind-next.css`
(`frontend-build/npm run build:css:next`) -- `docs/Backlog.md`'s existing
MEDIUM item "tailwind-next.css has no build-freshness check and will
silently go stale again" (~line 3700), caught this time by the PR/CI
review session grepping the built CSS rather than by any test here, since
the source-text tests above only look at app.js and cannot see whether the
classes they assert exist were ever compiled. TestBuiltCssHasTheNewClasses
below is a narrow, concrete instance of that Backlog item's fix #1 (a
freshness check) -- scoped to just the fragile bracket/colon classes this
fix introduced (the ones with no "coincidentally already present" escape
hatch), not the general rebuild-and-diff CI check the Backlog item still
asks for."""
