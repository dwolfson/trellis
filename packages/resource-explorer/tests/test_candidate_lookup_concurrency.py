"""A stage load waited in series on round trips that had no reason to be serial.

Measured 2026-08-31: `/candidates` took ~24s cold and 0.12s warm, and the UI
issued it **twice** — once scoped to the stage, once unscoped for cross-stage
`automate_full` definitions. Two independent causes, fixed separately:

  server  `find_candidate_process_guids_by_questions` resolved one Egeria GUID
          per question, strictly one after another. Ten questions for a stage;
          **49** for the unscoped call, because no `phase` means every cataloged
          question.
  client  the two fetches were awaited one after the other.

Neither was work. Both were waiting.

UPDATED 2026-09-04: `_resolve_question_guids` no longer builds its own
`ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8)`. It submits to the ONE bounded shared
pool per process (`resource_explorer/concurrency.py`), and it submits
`_resolve_one_pooled` — the cached lookup minus the pool hop — rather than
`resolve_question_guid`, so a pooled task never re-enters the pool. That
nesting (a pool of 8 workers each opening a one-worker pool of its own) was
what `docs/process-model.md` §1.3 flagged as the incident's shape. The
concurrency this file pins is unchanged; only which callable is submitted
is, which is why the patch targets below moved.

UPDATED 2026-09-03 (commit 6c402e8): the client half of this fix (make the
second fetch concurrent with the first) was superseded by removing the
second fetch outright — the cross-stage `automate_full` merge it existed to
speed up turned out not to be load-bearing at all (Automate's own Surveys
sub-tab already lists it). The server-half fix (concurrent GUID resolution
within one fetch) still stands and is still what most of this file pins.
