"""Tests for the filesystem reachability check — Phase 1 slice #13
(COORDINATOR-BRIEF-MULTI-RESOURCE.md, egeria-support-for-multi-resource.md
§5/§9/§10, `docs/design-notes/RESOURCE-REACHABILITY-IMPLEMENTED.md`).

`classify_check_asset_result` is pure (no network/registry dependency) and
is tested directly against the live-confirmed raw response shapes recorded
in `PROBES-2026-09-21.md`'s "Probes 7 and 8, run live" section — these are
not guessed strings, they are the actual completion messages Egeria
returned. The registry read/write path is tested against a throwaway
SQLite file, same fixture shape as test_db_fs_structured_tables.py.

`check_filesystem_reachability` itself (the live-network function) is NOT
unit-tested here — it needs a real Egeria platform, which is exactly what
the module docstring's "never raises for an Egeria-side failure" contract
exists to make safe to call speculatively. What IS fully unit-testable
without a live server, per the task's own framing, is the three-state
absence-discipline logic — that is what this file covers.
