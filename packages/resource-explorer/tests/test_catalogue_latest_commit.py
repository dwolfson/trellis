"""A reload must not forget the commit the page was watching: `GET /api/catalogue-scope/{slug}/commits/latest`.

The newest catalog commit for a database, read from the REGISTRY (the curation record's steps and run state, the
proof-derived schema states), so a second tab and a reload see the same thing. Read-only: it writes nothing and never
contacts Egeria. Everything here runs against a temp SQLite registry."""
