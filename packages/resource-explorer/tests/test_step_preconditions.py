"""Conditional execution: a step that cannot say anything is skipped, loudly.

Before this, every selected step ran. `cve_scan` on a repo with no parsed
dependencies read `project_dependencies`, found nothing, and correctly declined
rather than claiming "no CVEs" — but it was dispatched, timed, published as an
analysis, and counted by `security_summary` among its eight inputs as *never
ran*, pushing the verdict below its floor. A step with nothing to work on still
consumed a slot in every downstream picture.

The whole risk of fixing that is trading one silence for another. These tests
pin the difference: a skip is **emitted with a reason**, never an omission, and
it is kept apart from both "ran" and "failed" because it is neither.
