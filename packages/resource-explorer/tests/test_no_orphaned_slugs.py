"""No row may reference a resource slug that no longer exists.

This is a trap turned into a test. Two of them, really:

  * `project_published_annotation_types` and `project_published_analyses` carry
    a `project_slug` with NO declared foreign key to `projects.slug`, so
    Postgres will not stop a delete from stranding their rows -- and
    `ProjectRegistry.remove()` does not clean them up.
  * Removing the stale `trellis` repo on 2026-08-28 stranded exactly one row in
    `project_published_annotation_types`. Nothing noticed. Nothing would have.

The FK-declared tables are already safe by construction; the value here is the
ones that are not, and the fact that this test DISCOVERS slug-bearing tables
from the live schema rather than from a hand-maintained list. A list would have
been written against today's schema and gone stale the first time a table was
added -- which is exactly how the two above came to exist unguarded.

#   - the row describes something that HAPPENED (a question asked, a decision

#     Deleting the local resource does not delete the remote element.

# that is now gone -- is orphan debris and should cascade instead.
