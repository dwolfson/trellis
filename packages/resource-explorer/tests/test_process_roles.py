"""Step 2a of docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md: the worker role, leader
election, the un-looped web lifespan, and the one shared sync pool.

What each group is actually pinning, and why it would not be caught
otherwise:

* **Leader election** — the property is "two processes, one leader." A
  single-process test cannot observe it, so these take two independent
  locks on two independent connections against the real Postgres and
  assert the second loses. Marked `requires_pgvector`: `pg_try_advisory_
  lock` has no in-memory equivalent, and a mocked one would pin the mock.
* **The web lifespan starts no loop** — the regression this guards is
  silent by construction. If `--no-embed-worker` still started the
  scheduler, everything would keep working; you would only find out when
  two processes double-fired a schedule, which looks like a scheduling
  bug rather than a wiring bug.
* **The shared pool's timeout** — the incident's containment. A test that
  only checked the happy path would pass against a pool with the timeout
  removed.
* **nest_asyncio** — asserted as an import-graph fact, not behaviour,
  because the harm was a global patch applied at import time.
