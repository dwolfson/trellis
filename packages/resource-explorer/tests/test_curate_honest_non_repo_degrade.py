"""Curate is a generic `/next` nav item (reachable for any resource type),
but everything it does is built entirely against repo-only
`/api/projects/{slug}/...` routes (curate_plan.py, `registry.get(slug)` — the
repo-only `projects` table). Clicking Curate for a database/filesystem used
to reach `getCuratePlan(slug)` and 404 with no explanation — indistinguishable
from a real failure.

Fix: `renderCurate` in `web/static/next/stages/curate.js` now detects the
resource type first (`apiEntityType(state.resourceType)`) and, for anything
other than `repo`, renders an honest "not available for this type yet"
message instead of making any repo-only call — the same pattern
`understanding.js`'s `loadChartsPane`/`nonRepoChartIndexHtml` already uses
for its own deliberately-repo-only chart kinds.

These tests pin the fix at the source level (this codebase's established
technique for JS with no test runner wired in — see
`test_fact_answer_rendering.py`), by brace-matching the function bodies out
of the raw source text rather than executing them.
