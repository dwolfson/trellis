"""A CVE scan that says what it could not check.

Two findings from building this against real data, both preserved as tests
because either would ship a confident wrong answer:

* OSV returns EVERY advisory for a package when it cannot parse the version.
  numpy 1.23.5 is clean; the version as the manifest parser stores it
  ("==1.23.5 \\") returned 13. Across one real repo this was 45 reported
  advisories where the truth was 2.
* "No dependencies recorded" is not "no vulnerable dependencies". A repo whose
  manifests were never parsed would otherwise come back clean.
