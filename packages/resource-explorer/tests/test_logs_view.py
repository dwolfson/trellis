"""The log viewer, and the three empties it must not conflate.

An empty log list has at least three causes — nothing logged, the buffer emptied
by a restart, a filter that excluded everything — and rendering them alike is the
absence-as-answer failure this codebase keeps finding (see `null_pct: 0.0`, and
`cii_badge`'s unreachable-vs-not-registered). The buffer being in-memory makes
the second cause routine rather than theoretical, so it is asserted here.
