"""Discovery's corpus-level "find and import candidate repos" in /next
(NEXT-DISCOVERY-IMPORT-SEARCH-IMPLEMENTED.md): a real port of classic's
(index.html) GitHub search, `/from-list` bulk loader, and inventory CSV
export -- placed at the sidebar's `find-repos` action rather than inside
`stages/discovery.js`, per SPEC-ACTIONABLE-AND-HONEST.md point 2's ruling
that finding/importing repos is corpus-level work, not a Discovery-stage
affordance.

No browser verification with a signed-in session is asserted by these
tests -- see docs/design-notes/NEXT-DISCOVERY-IMPORT-SEARCH-IMPLEMENTED.md
for what was checked live. These tests grep/slice the concatenated source,
the established pattern for /next JS modules without a browser -- see
test_next_automate_pane.py / test_next_curate_pane.py's identical `_app()`
helper, reproduced here plus the new standalone module's own source.
