"""Backend tests for the append-only Question catalog write path
(resource_explorer/surveyors/question_catalog_writer.py), the real new
backend surface SPEC-ADMIN-THE-FOUR-GAPS.md §4 asked for.

**Decision (project owner, 2026-09-20):** append-only — add and retire are
the only two operations; a reword-in-place must be refused by the backend
itself, not merely left off the UI. `test_add_refuses_when_question_already_exists`
and `test_add_refuses_when_retired_question_text_reused` are that invariant
under direct test, per the task's own instruction to prove editing "is not
accepted by the backend even if attempted directly against the route."

Isolated from the real docs/dr-egeria/resource_questions.csv and
resource_explorer/configdata/question_catalog.yaml via monkeypatching the
module's path constants — these tests never touch the committed catalog.
