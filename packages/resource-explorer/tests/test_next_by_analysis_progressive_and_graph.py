"""By-analysis panel rebuild -- progressive render + headline-first cards +
grouped COUNTS + shared-names-once + inline Relationship Graph card body
(BRIEF-BY-ANALYSIS-PANEL-USABILITY.md +
REPLY-DESIGNER-ROUND2-DATABASE-SCREENS.md §2, 2026-09-28).

Two problems this rebuild exists for, both live-confirmed by the project
owner: `loadByAnalysisPane` sat on "Reading the dashboards…" for up to 109s
with nothing else visible (the OLD code's own comment named this cost and
did nothing about it), and the Relationship Graph card showed only numbers,
never the graph `factGraphviz` already knows how to render.

No browser verification with a signed-in session is asserted by these
tests -- same static-source-assertion pattern `test_next_db_server_
discovery.py` and `test_next_schema_inventory_filter.py` established; see
this branch's own IMPLEMENTED doc for what was verified live instead.
