# Egeria operations — recovery, resync, and republishing

**Status:** consolidated runbook. Current as of 2026-09-02.
**This is the operational manual.** For how Resource Explorer integrates with
Egeria by design, see `egeria-integration.md`.

> **This document consolidates five runbooks:** recovery and resync (the spine),
> platform-reset recovery, republishing a changed survey definition, authoring a
> database survey definition, and invoking lineage capture.

## 0. The one thing to read if you read nothing else

**Not one of the five bugs found during the 2026-08-31 recovery raised an error.**

A successful promotion showed a red toast. A scan reported zero while 36 items needed
repair. A card never rendered. A claim outlived the report it named. A count could not
decrease no matter how much work was completed.

Every one of them looked exactly like *nothing to do here*. So the governing rule of this
document is:

> **A zero is a claim, not a result.** Before believing a recovery is complete, confirm
> the thing you want is PRESENT. Do not accept that the thing you feared is ABSENT.

Concretely: after relinking, do not check that "unlinked members = 0". Ask Egeria for the
collection's member list and count what is in it. Those two questions came apart on the
night — the scan said 0 because it could not see the members at all.

---

## 1. Which flavour are you in?

The flavours are distinguished by **what was lost**, not by what you did.

| # | Flavour | Symptom | What was lost | Go to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Platform reset / redeploy** | Everything in Egeria is gone; RE looks fine | All Egeria elements. **Nothing of RE's.** | §2 |
| 2 | **Changed definition** | A survey gained/lost a step | Nothing — this is a deliberate edit | [publishing-a-changed-definition](egeria-operations.md (§9)) |
| 3 | **Drift without a reset** | "I published it but cannot find it" | One asset, or one link | §3 |
| 4 | **Half-finished recovery** | Some repos catalogued, some not | Nothing new — but see §4, this flavour has its own trap | §4 |
| 5 | **RE registry lost** | RE is empty; Egeria is fine | RE's own tables | §5 |

**Flavour 1 is the common one and the one most often mis-diagnosed.** A wipe destroys
Egeria and leaves RE's registry untouched *by design* — that is the premise
`egeria_resync.py` is built on. Which leads directly to:

### 1a. How to tell whether a wipe has actually happened

On the night, a session answered "has Egeria been wiped?" by counting rows in RE's
`projects` and `project_analysis_findings` tables, found 60 and 68,215, and concluded it
had not. Those tables read **identically on both sides of a wipe**, so the measurement
could not distinguish the two states at all. A correct count of the wrong population.

Ask something that only exists on one side of the event:

```bash
uv run python -c "
from resource_explorer.registry import ProjectRegistry
with ProjectRegistry()._conn() as c:
    print('assets  :', c.execute(\"SELECT count(*) FROM projects WHERE coalesce(egeria_asset_guid,'')<>''\").fetchone()[0])
    print('reports :', c.execute('SELECT count(*) FROM project_egeria_surveys').fetchone()[0])"
```

Both zero, on a corpus that was previously published, means the assets are gone and the
sweep has already cleared the pointers. Both non-zero means you are not in flavour 1.

---

## 2. Flavour 1 — platform reset

### 2.1 Let bootstrap heal. Do not hand-run Dr.Egeria documents.

`bootstrap.check_and_heal()` re-runs any batch whose canary is missing, every 10 minutes
while the web server is up, then runs the post-heal reconciler. On a wiped platform every
canary is missing, so it heals unattended.

**Two people intervening on top of that is the worst available outcome.** Dr.Egeria's link
commands do not dedupe — one deliberate publish on 2026-08-31 produced 40 duplicate edges
across two definitions. There is a reconciler for those. For the questions batch's 168
perspective links **there is none**, so duplicates there have no cleanup path at all.

If a fix is needed, **one person drives and everyone else stays off Egeria entirely.**

### 2.2 Verify the heal — the canary is not the verification

**A canary proves a batch RAN, not that every element in it exists.** That is exactly how
8 of 49 catalog questions sat missing for weeks while the batch reported healthy.

Four checks, and all four must pass:

```
questions              49/49 resolve
RepoAssessmentSurvey   10 steps · reducer present · runs after all 8 inputs
RepoFullSurvey         35 steps · reducer present · runs after all 8 inputs
reconciler --dry-run   0 duplicate / 0 stale across all EIGHT definitions
```

Check **"runs after all its inputs"**, not "runs last". They are different requirements and
only the second is real: `repo_security_summary` is terminal in Assessment but *not* in
Full, where `repo_rag_ingestion` must stay last. "Last" passed under two different wrong
arrangements on 2026-08-31.

Perspectives are **not** covered by any of the above and must be checked separately:

```bash
uv run python scripts/verify_perspectives.py   # 0 all present · 1 missing · 2 undetermined
```

> Its first live run produced **three false OKs**, because it fell back to `displayName`,
> which is not unique across types — `Community`, `Privacy` and `Steward` resolved to
> unrelated elements. It reported 9 of 12 missing when the answer was 12. It is
> qualifiedName-only now. The lesson generalises: **run a new check against a known state
> before trusting it**, because a check that has never been seen to fail is a check nobody
> knows works.

### 2.3 Then use Admin → 🔄 Egeria Alignment for everything else

This is the part no older runbook describes. **Scanning never writes.** Repairs run only
for steps you tick, always in dependency order regardless of tick order.

`REPAIR_STEPS` — the order is load-bearing:

| # | Step | What it does | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `reauthor_survey_definitions` | Re-runs the definitions batch + reconciler | slow, writes |
| 2 | `clear_stale_assets` | Drops asset GUIDs that no longer resolve | local only |
| 3 | `clear_orphan_publish_claims` | Drops claims naming reports that are gone | local only |
| 4 | `clear_stale_investigations` | Clears dead Project/Collection GUIDs | local only |
| 5 | `clear_stale_contexts` | Resets contexts pointing at dead Projects | local only |
| 6 | `catalog_assets` | Publishes `repo_health` → registers the asset | **no downloads** |
| 7 | `republish_survey_results` | Full survey → SurveyReport | **slow, downloads archives** |
| 8 | `relink_investigation_members` | Attaches members to their assets | fast, writes |

**Why the order matters, stated as failures rather than rules:**

- Publishing before clearing reuses a dead GUID.
- Relinking before cataloguing can do nothing — a member with no asset behind it cannot be
  attached. *This is why a promotion on a freshly rebuilt platform reports every member
  unlinkable, and it is not a fault.*
- Clearing orphan claims used to be outrun by cataloguing (see §4).

### 2.4 It is a TWO-PASS operation, and the first pass looks wrong

Expect this, because it was mistaken for failure twice on the night:

**Pass 1** — tick `catalog_assets`. Its card then goes to **0 and disappears**, and a
*different* card (`registration_only`) appears in its place with a similar count. On
2026-08-31 that read as "28 → 23, so 5 failed". Nothing had failed; all 28 succeeded.

**Pass 2** — click **Re-scan**. Only now can these appear, because they depend on the
assets existing:

- `orphan_publish_claims` — tick it
- `unlinked_members` — tick it; this is the one that ends the "0 linked" state
- `registration_only` — the slow full publish, unticked by default

**The counts line separates the two kinds:** *"0 repairable · 28 slow, not selected"*. The
second number does not go down when you complete work — it is work you declined, and it
persists across every re-scan by design.

---

## 3. Flavour 3 — drift without a reset

Run the Alignment scan. It reports drift in both directions, and splits it into what has
**one correct repair** (a button) and what **needs a person** (no button, marked *your
call*). The second category is deliberate: RE does not know which Egeria Project an
unbound resource should join, and a guess written into the catalog reads exactly like a
decision.

For the single-asset case, see
[`egeria-operations.md (§8)` §3](egeria-operations.md (§8)) — unchanged and still correct.

---

## 4. Flavour 4 — the half-finished recovery, and why it has its own section

**A partially-completed recovery can put work permanently out of reach of the repair that
was meant to do it.** This is the least obvious flavour and produced the worst bug of the
night.

`clear_orphan_publish_claims` originally keyed on *"the project has no asset"*. So the
moment `catalog_assets` gave a repo its asset back, that repo's pre-wipe claims became
invisible to both the repair and the scan that surfaces it. The claims survived
**precisely because the situation had been half-repaired** — running the repairs in the
order the panel offers them meant the cataloguing step outran the clearing step.

Measured: the scan reported **0** while **36 orphaned claims across 12 repos** existed.

Both are now keyed on the claim itself — a claim whose `egeria_report_guid` is absent from
`project_egeria_surveys` names a report nothing stands behind, whether or not the project
currently has an asset. It can no longer be outrun.

**The general lesson for anyone writing a repair:** key it on the damage, not on a
correlate of the damage that another repair is going to change.

---

## 5. Flavour 5 — RE's registry lost

Not covered here, and deliberately so: nothing in this document restores RE's own tables.
RE's registry is the system of record for survey results — Egeria holds what was
*published*, which is a subset. Restore it from your Postgres backup. Re-surveying is not
equivalent: it re-derives current state, and loses the history that
`project_analysis_findings` and the `surveyed_at`-stamped tables carry.

---

## 6. What does *not* need doing

- **Re-surveying before publishing.** Publish runs `SurveyOrchestrator.run(slug)` itself,
  so a survey first just does the work twice.
- **Re-promoting an investigation that already has a Project GUID.** Dr.Egeria batches are
  not idempotent, and perspective links have no reconciler.
- **Anything to RE's local data after an Egeria wipe.** It is intact. Check before acting.

---

## 7. Traps, each of which cost time

- **`node --check` with the wrong Node.** nvm can move `node` under you; v14 cannot parse
  `||=` and reports valid code as a syntax error. Verify with a runtime matching browsers.
- **Start the app WITHOUT `--reload`.** `SourceCache` uses the relative path
  `data/source-cache`, so zipballs extract inside the tree uvicorn watches. Every large
  survey restarts the server and kills itself **silently** — no error, just zero rows. A
  `manifest_parse` ran ten minutes and wrote nothing before this was found.
- **A stale panel is not stale code.** The Alignment panel caches its scan in the page. On
  2026-08-31 a fix was correctly loaded and running while the browser showed the old
  numbers. Use the panel's **Re-scan** button, not just a browser refresh. To settle it,
  ask the server: `curl -s localhost:8810/api/egeria/resync/scan`.
- **`git add <path>` is per-file, not per-hunk.** An uncommitted edit to a file another
  session is also touching gets swept into their commit.
- **An empty result is not an unknown result.** pyegeria returns the *string*
  `"No members found"` for an empty collection. Treating that as malformed sent all three
  investigations to `undetermined`, so the relink card never rendered — in exactly the
  state the repair exists for.

# Part II — Republishing, authoring, and platform reset

*Merged 2026-09-02 from four runbooks.*

## 8. After a platform reset

*(from `egeria-reset-recovery.md`, written from an actual reset)*

1. **Let the bootstrap heal the definitions, then verify it.** `bootstrap.check_and_heal()`
   re-runs any batch whose canary is missing, every 10 minutes while the web server is up. On a
   wiped platform it heals unattended — let it, and verify the result rather than hand-running
   documents on top of it.
2. **Deal with the stale asset GUIDs.** `scripts/sweep_stale_egeria_guids.py` clears them.
3. **Do not expect the outbox to restore anything.**

> ### The outbox does NOT restore anything
>
> This is the most confidently wrong state in the registry after a reset. A row is marked `done`
> with the GUID it created, `apply_element` short-circuits on a recorded GUID and returns without
> writing, and a `done` row is never claimed again. Those rows **assert a completed publish, point
> at an element that is gone, and the retry machinery deliberately will not touch them.**
>
> **Recovery is re-running the surveys, not draining the queue.** *"The outbox guarantees delivery"*
> is the natural assumption and it is wrong across a wipe: the queue guarantees delivery of work it
> still considers *pending*, and a reset does not make completed work pending again.

The sweep keys on the resource having no asset GUID rather than looking each row up: an annotation
hangs off a SurveyReport which hangs off the asset, so if the asset is gone, everything published
beneath it is gone.

## 9. Republishing a changed survey definition

*(from `egeria-publishing-a-changed-definition.md`, written from an actual publish)*

Author in dependency order, do not reconcile in the middle, reconcile once at the end, then **prove
the deletes happened** — and verify against the definitions rather than against the output.

Four traps, each of which cost real time:

- **A step's position in `STEP_REGISTRY` is its position in the Full Survey chain.** "Repo Full
  Survey" is generated from the `*` sentinel — every registry step *in that dict's own order*. A
  new step added beside related ones lands wherever they are: a reducer written next to the other
  security steps landed at index 21 of 34, **ahead of two of its own inputs**. Read the generated
  chain before publishing it.
- **"Runs last" and "runs after its inputs" are different requirements.** Moving that reducer to the
  end fixed Full Survey and broke `test_rag_ingestion_runs_last` — `repo_rag_ingestion` is the most
  expensive step and nothing reads it, so it stays terminal. Two steps wanted the same slot; only
  one needed it. **Assert the property you actually need.**
- **Authored is not published.** Regenerating a document changes only the file. Both problems that
  day were this same state: a definition regenerated and never run, and a questions document
  regenerated months earlier and never re-run, leaving 8 of 49 terms absent. A live smoke test
  catches the first. **Nothing catches the second** — a batch's canary proves the batch *ran*, not
  that every element in it exists.
- **A blocked Egeria write is not something to work around.** If the operation is refused, it makes
  permanent changes to someone's platform. Hand it to the person who owns it.

## 10. Authoring a database survey definition

*(from `egeria-database-survey-definition.md`)*

A validated Dr.Egeria recipe for defining a database survey: create the process steps, create the
governance action process, link the first step, chain the rest. This is the template to copy for any
new survey definition, database or otherwise — the mechanics do not vary by resource type.

## 11. Invoking lineage capture

*(from `egeria-lineage-invocation.md`)*

The `sql_analysis` step parses view definitions with `sqlglot` and produces two kinds of lineage:

- **Design lineage** — column-to-column. Physical columns in base tables mapped to derived columns
  in the view, as `LineageMapping` relationships between `DatabaseColumn` entities.
- **Process lineage** — the transformation itself. A `Process` entity for the view, linked to source
  tables via `DataFlow` input relationships and to its output attributes via `DataFlow` outputs.

Invoked through a Dr.Egeria plan in the same shape as §10.
