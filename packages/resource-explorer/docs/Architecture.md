# Resource Explorer — Architecture

**Last revised:** 2026-08-30. Supersedes the 2026-06-10 revision, which described a
SQLite-only registry, ten sub-surveyors and eleven web routes — the counts are now 51 tables,
33 sub-surveyors and 25 route modules.

This document describes **shape**: layers, boundaries, and how work flows through them. It
deliberately does not enumerate every module, because the previous revision did and that is
precisely what went stale — 157 modules existed that it did not mention. Directories and
responsibilities change slowly; file lists change weekly.

- Conventions and rules for *working on* this code: [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)
- Getting it running: [the workspace quickstart](../../../QUICKSTART.md)
- What is being worked on: [`Backlog.md`](Backlog.md)
- The process and threading model — every daemon thread, per-request thread and
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` in the current one-process design, plus the target multi-role topology
  from `docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md`: [`process-model.md`](process-model.md)

---

## Overview

Resource Explorer discovers, understands and catalogs information resources — Git
repositories, PostgreSQL databases and file systems — using [Egeria](https://egeria-project.org/)
as the catalog of record.

**Egeria-first, and Egeria is now a hard dependency for *access*.** Every survey result that can
be written to Egeria should be. Local storage is a cache and a queue, so the tool keeps working
while Egeria is briefly unreachable and reconciles afterwards.

**But Egeria is also the identity provider** (2026-09-04, `docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md`
§4): RE requires login, and the only way to sign in is an Egeria user id and password exchanged
for an Egeria bearer token. The older claim that "RAG-based querying needs no Egeria at all" is
retired — the querying itself still needs none, but reaching it requires a session, and a session
requires Egeria. `TRELLIS_ANONYMOUS_READ=true` is the one remaining way to run without one and is
a dev-box override, not a supported mode.

Two layers:

1. **Survey layer** — collects structure and metadata from resources, writes locally, and
   publishes to Egeria.
2. **Query layer** — answers natural-language questions from survey metadata, RAG over
   pgvector, and specialist agents.

---

## Storage

**The registry is PostgreSQL by default**, in a named `resource_explorer` schema inside the
`egeria_advisor` database shared with Egeria Advisor. SQLite remains a supported fallback via
`REGISTRY_DATABASE_URL` — used by tests and single-user setups. Both are driven through the
same `ProjectRegistry` API; nothing above it knows which is underneath.

*(The previous revision claimed "all persistent state lives in a single SQLite file". That
stopped being true when the shared Postgres instance arrived, and the claim survived because
nothing tested it.)*

Vector data lives in the same Postgres via pgvector, in per-resource collections named
`{slug}_{collection_type}`, created lazily on first insert.

### Table families

51 tables, which group into six families rather than needing individual description:

| Family | Examples | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| **Resource identity** | `projects`, `databases`, `file_systems`, `db_servers`, `project_aliases`, `project_groups` | One row per registered resource |
| **Collected facts** | `project_stats`, `project_commits`, `project_file_inventory`, `project_code_symbols`, `project_dependencies` | Refreshed in place or appended per run |
| **Analysis results** | `project_analysis_findings`, `project_analysis_metrics`, `project_file_type_counts` | Append-only, `surveyed_at`-stamped, latest-batch reads |
| **Human judgement** | `resource_context`, `resource_tags`, `resource_feedback`, `resource_curator_notes`, `repo_dispositions`, `investigations` | What a person decided, never inferred |
| **Machine attention** | `resource_schedules`, `notification_subscriptions`, `rfa_actions` | Recurring work and its delivery |
| **Egeria linkage** | `project_egeria_surveys`, `entity_egeria_project_context`, `egeria_linkage_status`, `survey_definition_cache` | What is published, and what Egeria said |

Two properties matter more than the list:

- **Analysis results are append-only.** A survey run does not overwrite its predecessor; it
  adds a `surveyed_at`-stamped batch. History is the point — trends, and "what changed since
  last time", both depend on it.
- **Collected facts and analysis results are different tables on purpose.** Most analyses do
  not write to `project_analysis_findings`; they read `project_stats` or the file inventory and
  report over it. Assuming the findings table is where results live is a mistake that has been
  made twice, most recently by the context compiler.

**Process roles, one codebase.** `resource-explorer web` serves HTTP; `resource-explorer
worker` owns the background loops; `resource-explorer serve` is the `a2a` role. `web
--embed-worker` (the default, so `make dev` stays one command) runs the worker role in-process.
Which process actually runs a given loop is decided by a Postgres advisory lock, not by startup
order, so a second RE process against the same registry stands by rather than double-firing.
`make ps` lists every trellis process and container, `re-a2a` among them.
Full detail, including the advisory keys: [`process-model.md`](process-model.md).

**The A2A surface is one port and requires a token.** `resource-explorer serve --port 8090` hosts
all seven agents (orchestrator, stats, code, docs, health, compare, integration) on a single
service: `/agents/<name>` for each, `/` for the orchestrator as the default, an A2A agent card per
agent at its own well-known path, and `/.well-known/agents.json` as an index of all of them for a
Portal or external orchestrator to discover. Every agent call needs
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` — either a trellis app JWT or a raw Egeria bearer token validated
once against the view server and cached for the token's own lifetime. This replaced seven
unauthenticated servers on ports 8080-8086. See [`a2a.md`](a2a.md).

**Work is queued, not threaded.** A route that starts a survey writes a row to the `runs` table
and returns; a `worker` process claims it (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), heartbeats every
30s while it runs, and writes the terminal state. The browser's contract is unchanged — it still
polls `GET /api/activity/{id}` and reads the result out of that entry's `detail`; the queue row
carries that activity id in `result_ref`. `GET /api/runs?state=queued` is the queue's own view,
and the way to tell "nothing is draining the queue" from "this survey is slow".

**`workflows/` is what makes the CLI a peer of the web tier.** Each module is a plain function
over explicit arguments returning a result dataclass, with no FastAPI anywhere
(`tests/test_workflows.py` pins that by parsing the imports). The route, the Typer command and
the queue handler are three callers of one function rather than three implementations — so
`resource-explorer analysis run <project>` and clicking Run do the same thing by construction.

Shared libraries live outside this package and are imported: `trellis-vectorstore`,
`trellis-context`, `trellis-artifact-tree`, `trellis-microflow`, `trellis-querycache`,
`trellis-auth`. See the [workspace architecture](../../../docs/trellis-architecture.md).

## The survey layer

### Three concepts, deliberately distinct

Conflating these has caused real bugs, so they are named precisely:

| Concept | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Survey Definition** | A named, ordered graph of steps — "run these, in this order" | Egeria, as a `GovernanceActionProcess`; mirrored locally in authored Dr.Egeria documents |
| **Step** (microflow) | One unit of work — "classify the languages" | `surveyors/sub_surveyors/`, 33 of them, keyed by a step name like `repo_health` |
| **Analysis** | A catalog entry describing a result a person can look at | `configdata/analysis_catalog.yaml`, tagged by intent |

An analysis usually maps to one step, occasionally to several, and four steps have no analysis
at all. They are not synonyms and the mapping is explicit
(`REPO_ANALYSIS_STEP_MAP`, `REPO_ANALYSIS_RESULTS_MAP`).

### Flow

Two paths, and confusing them is easy because only one of them is named after the thing it does.

**Repo steps** run through `SurveyOrchestrator`:

```
SurveyOrchestrator.run(slug, steps=None)
  → resolves steps (all, or a named subset)
  → acquires shared resources (zipball, git clone) via trellis-microflow
  → runs each step → Annotation objects
  → writes results to the step's own table
  → writes ONE activity_log entry
  → optionally publishes to Egeria
```

`steps=None` runs everything; a list runs exactly those. That parameter is what lets a single
analysis or a scheduled bundle share one execution path.

**A whole Survey Definition, on any resource type**, runs through
`surveyors/survey_definition_executor.py` instead — a generic dispatch loop over the step
graph, plus a `ResourceTypeAdapter` registered per resource type
(`repo_survey_definition_adapter.py`, `database/survey_definition_adapter.py`,
`filesystem/survey_definition_adapter.py`). That adapter layer is what makes Survey Definitions
executable uniformly across repos, databases and filesystems; `SurveyOrchestrator` is the repo
adapter's own machinery, not the general path.

### Resource acquisition

**Acquired once per commit, not once per run.** A zipball or treeless clone is cached on disk
by `github/source_cache.py`, keyed on `(repo, commit SHA)`, so a re-survey of unchanged code
pays nothing — and the key is what makes a stale hit impossible. Within a single run, steps
also share one acquisition rather than each taking its own; that part has been true since
2026-08-20 and is not what made surveys fast.

The 110.5s → 14.4s measured on `egeria_python_git` came from two unrelated fixes, and it is
worth knowing which, because the obvious explanation is the wrong one:

- **`--find-renames=100%`** in `arch_recovery/cochange.py` — about 92s of it. `git log
  --name-only`'s default *inexact* rename detection scores blob-content similarity, and the
  history root is a `--filter=blob:none` clone, so every comparison was a lazy fetch: 86
  upload-pack round trips inside one `git log`. Exact-rename detection compares blob OIDs
  already in the tree. 41s → 0.03s on a cold clone.
- **`SourceCache`** — acquisition 22.6s cold → 1.3s warm.

### Two coordinators, neither of which is RE

RE is not a workflow engine. Either **Egeria coordinates** and RE executes leaf steps as an
engine host, or **RE coordinates** and hands the graph to **Prefect**. Each step declares
`executes_at: resource-explorer | prefect | egeria`. With Prefect unreachable, steps fall back
to running in-process — safe, one connection attempt slower.

A step marked `executes_at: egeria` is **not skipped** while RE coordinates. The adapter's
`other_engine_handlers` lets RE actively trigger Egeria's own native survey engine for that one
step and carry on coordinating the rest of the graph locally — both the database and filesystem
adapters do this. That mechanism is the intended route for unifying database and filesystem
survey launching (see `Backlog.md`, "Unify survey launching"), and it is untested end to end on
either type.

### Publishing

`EgeriaPublisher` finds or creates a `SourceControlLibrary` asset by exact `qualifiedName`,
then attaches a `SurveyReport` and one annotation per result. The exact-match search is load-
bearing: a prefix match once made two sibling repos share an asset, and each other's findings.

---

## The query layer

```
Query (web / CLI / A2A)
  → QueryCache                        hit → return
  → QueryProcessor.classify()
      ├── survey_meta → answered from the registry, no vector search
      ├── statistical / comparison / examples / code_search / conceptual / health → specialist agent
      └── general → RAG (CollectionRouter → pgvector → LLM)
  → optionally: compiled evidence (see below)
  → LLM generation
  → async: tracing, metrics, cache store
```

`survey_meta` is evaluated first and never touches pgvector — "when was this last surveyed"
is a registry read, and routing it through retrieval would be slower and worse.

### Compiled context

A newer path, and the one that changes answer quality most. `context_compile.py` turns a
question into a `ContextSpec`: the question catalog already maps Purpose and Perspective to
questions and to the analyses that answer them, so those analyses become **sections**, stored
results become **candidates**, and `trellis-context` packs what fits a character budget.

What it returns alongside the text matters as much as the text:

- **manifest** — what was packed and at which rung, what was dropped for budget, and what is
  **missing**
- **derivation** — why each section is there: this Purpose ranked that question, which
  dispatches this analysis

Sections resolve through the **fact layer**, not raw results, so a gap distinguishes *never
ran* from *ran and found nothing*. Nothing is executed to fill a gap — a compile never blocks
on a survey.

### Model tiers and the RAG context budget

See [`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md`](../../../docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md) §5 (repo root) for the full design and the measurements behind it
(prompt tokens, not model size, is the lever for time-to-first-token). `EXPLORER_MODEL_TIER`
(`dev` default / `demo-gpu` / `demo-cpu`) resolves, per machine profile, the Ollama model,
Ollama's `num_ctx` ceiling, and the RAG retrieval context budget together —
`resource_explorer/config.py`'s `TIER_PRESETS`, mirroring Egeria Advisor's
`advisor/config.py` (same tier names, same `num_ctx`/budget values) so the two apps converge
rather than drift. `dev` keeps today's unbounded behaviour (`num_ctx=32768`, no RAG budget); the
demo tiers cap `num_ctx` at 8192 and the RAG context budget at ~2000 tokens. An explicit
`LLM__OLLAMA__MODEL` still wins over the tier's model. `num_ctx` is threaded through every
Ollama call RE makes — `llm_client.py`'s `OllamaBackend` (the raw `ollama` client's `options`)
and `agents/base.py`'s BeeAI `RequirementAgent` path (an `OllamaChatModel` built with
`settings={"num_ctx": ...}`, since BeeAI talks to Ollama over its OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
not the native one). The RAG context budget is applied in
`prompt_templates.py::build_context()`, used everywhere retrieved chunks are joined into a
prompt (`rag_system.py`, `agents/doc_agent.py`, `agents/code_agent.py`) — it keeps the
highest-ranked chunks and stops adding once the (approximate, 4 chars/token) estimate would
exceed the budget.

---

## Who a call runs as

`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §4, landed 2026-09-04. Three doors, one identity, one place
that decides what an Egeria write is attributed to.

**Login is required.** `trellis_auth.LoginRequiredMiddleware`, installed in `web/app.py` under the
policy `resource_explorer/auth.py` resolves (`TRELLIS_*` then `EXPLORER_*`, the app-specific one
winning). Public: `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/static/`, the SPA shell, the five `/api/auth/*`
routes, and `/.well-known/` — the A2A agent cards must be readable before a client holds the
credential they describe. Middleware order, measured rather than assumed, is
**CORS → login gate → identity → routes**: a cross-origin 401 keeps its CORS headers (without
them the browser reports an opaque network error and the login form never appears), and a
rejected request never sets an identity.

**Two ways in, one token.** The login form exchanges an Egeria user id and password for a bearer
token exactly once and forgets the password; the Portal hands over the token it already holds.
Either way RE mints its own HS256 session JWT carrying that bearer token — never a password — and
caps its expiry at the Egeria token's own. Sessions therefore last as long as Egeria's tokens do
(one hour by default, and every token dies when the platform restarts); refresh is a re-login.

**One identity mechanism.** `a2a_auth.current_caller` is a ContextVar, and all three doors set the
same one:

| Door | Sets it in |
|---|---|
| Browser / HTTP | `web/app.py::_identity_middleware` |
| A2A agent traffic | `a2a_auth.A2AAuthMiddleware` |
| CLI | `cli/session.activate()`, from the cached login |

Everything downstream asks `a2a_auth.caller()`. Nothing has to know which door a call came
through, and there is deliberately no second, web-shaped identity type.

**Per-request Egeria clients.** `egeria_identity.apply_identity` is the single place a pyegeria
client is authenticated. A signed-in person's client reuses *their* bearer token
(`set_bearer_token`), so Egeria's own provenance records the person rather than `erinoverview`.
The **worker role's own loops** — bootstrap heal, resync, outbox drain — keep the service account,
which is the correct attribution for them and the only legitimate use of it.

**Ownership is curation by default.** Everything RE publishes gets Egeria's `Ownership`
classification (`0445`) with `owner` = the requesting user and `ownerTypeName = "UserIdentity"`.
The owner may accept, reject, promote and delete with no separate grant; a `curator`/`admin` role
claim curates across resources it does not own; everyone else gets 403. Enforced in
`workflows/curate.py`, not in the routes, so the CLI and A2A inherit it.

**One draft zone per app.** *Everything* RE creates in Egeria — survey reports, the library
element, materialized components and blueprints — is born in `resource-explorer-draft`
(`ZoneMembership`, `0424`), and curate-accept promotes it into the deployment's publish zones
(`EXPLORER_PUBLISH_ZONES`, default `egeria-runtime`, which is what the quickstart configures). The
worker creates the zone itself once at startup, leader-elected.

"Everything, no exceptions" is a correction, made against the live platform on 2026-09-04. A
materialized component was at first written straight into the publish zones, on the reasoning that
it *is* the accepted outcome — and the accept path's promotion then failed with
`OMAG-SERVER-SECURITY-403-005: not authorized to change the zone membership ... from
[egeria-runtime] to [egeria-runtime]`. Egeria's security connector treats a no-op zone change as an
error, so a second code path with its own rule produced a permissions failure on a correct
operation. One rule removes the special case and makes the transition observable:
`promote_to_publish_zones` reports `from_zones` alongside `zones`, so "promoted" can be told from
"was already there".

**Trellis-side scoping.** `resource_working_set`, `entity_egeria_project_context` and
`conversation_history` carry `user_id`, resolved *in the registry layer* rather than by each
route — a route that has to remember to scope is a route that will not. `''` is the shared/legacy
bucket, and a read takes the caller's own row falling back to it, so nothing written before this
existed disappeared.

**Known gaps, named rather than hidden.** A queued run carries `requested_by` but no token — a
one-hour credential does not survive a queue — so the worker publishes as the service account with
`Ownership` set to the requester (`run_queue._run_as_requester`). And curator rights read the JWT
`role` claim; the plan's destination is Egeria `PersonRoleAppointment`s.

---

## Cross-cutting: absence is a first-class result

The single most common bug class in this codebase is **a result that looks like an answer and
is not**. Three vocabularies exist to prevent it, and they are not interchangeable:

- `surveyors/result_status.py` — `measured` / `nothing_found` / `not_established` /
  `never_run`, plus `skipped_by_design` and `misgrouped` for results that are absent on
  purpose rather than by failure
- `step_outcome.py` — `recovered` / `partial` / `no_signal` / `unverified` / `regression`,
  where `CONCLUSIVE` deliberately excludes `unverified`
- The compile manifest's **gaps**, which name analyses with no stored result

A zero from an analysis that never ran and a zero from one that ran and found nothing are
different facts. Surfaces that flatten them produce confident wrong answers, which is worse
than an error because nothing looks broken.

---

## The eight intents

`scouting` · `discovery` · `assessment` · `analysis` · `enrichment` · `understanding` ·
`curate` · `automate`

These are canonical strings, used in the activity log, UI filters, analysis catalog tags and
query routing. The axis that separates the early stages is **does this collect, or does it
reason over what is already collected** — not evaluative-versus-structural. See `CLAUDE.md`
rule 17, which carries the full reasoning and its exceptions.

---

## The activity log

Every scout, survey, catalog, publish and RFA operation writes an entry. It is the audit
trail and the UI's history view, and it is also load-bearing for correctness: the
"was this ever published?" check that distinguishes *lost an asset* from *never catalogued*
reads it rather than guessing.

---

## Key design rules

The full numbered list lives in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) and is not duplicated here —
one copy, deliberately. The ones with the most architectural reach:

- Classify intent before touching the vector store (rule 1)
- Activity log entries for **all** operations, not just Egeria publishes (rule 16)
- The eight intent labels are canonical (rule 17)
- `HybridDatabaseSurveyor` must run the local scan immediately after triggering Egeria's
  async native survey (rule 15)
