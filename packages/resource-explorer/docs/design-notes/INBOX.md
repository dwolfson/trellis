# Designer inbox

**One writer: the designer session.** This file is written by hand. The
designer reads each `*-IMPLEMENTED.md` and the commits that cite a reply,
then updates the row. Nothing generates it. Implementers never edit it:
signal by writing your `*-IMPLEMENTED.md` (it now lives in `implemented/`)
and naming the designer note it answers, by its bare filename.

**Last reconciled:** 2026-10-01, against `main` at `524f1c7f`, after the
design-notes move. Evidence for every row is an implemented note or a commit
that names the designer note. A row whose only evidence is a commit that
doesn't name the note says **unverified**. `TIMELINE.md` (the coordinator's)
was the cross-check for dates.

**The rule stays: unanswered until proven shipped.** A row with no citation
is *not built*, never *probably done*.

## The ledger

Newest first. "Answered" means the evidence covers the whole note.
"In part" names what's left.

† The 09-17 version of this ledger cited an implemented note for these
rows: `PORTS-ROUND-ONE`, `REPORT-ACTS`, `TWO-CALLS-AND-THE-RECORD`,
`FUNNEL-COST`, `FUNNEL-COST-STATUS`, `PROMOTION-AND-RAIL` and
`REVIEW-FIXES`. **None of those seven files was ever committed**, on any
branch. They must have lived in a working folder that never reached the
repo. The rows now cite the PRs and commits instead, and the one row with
no PR is marked unverified. The design notes aren't scanned by the
dangling-pointer test, which is why nothing caught this.

Dates are the ones written in each note. `TIMELINE.md` gives the commit date,
which is later for the notes that landed in the 09-16 bulk commit and for
the three reviews that landed in `81031e92`.

## Conventions

- Designer notes land in this folder's root. `REVIEW-*` reviews shipped work,
  `REPLY-*` answers a question, `SPEC-*` is something buildable, and
  `RULING-*` is a decision with consequences rather than a layout.
  Drawings go in `wireframes/` and on the canvas.
- Every designer note names the commit it was read against. If main has
  moved, say so rather than assuming the note is current.
- Implementer replies are `*-IMPLEMENTED.md` in `implemented/`. **Name the
  designer note you answer, by its bare filename**, so this ledger can cite
  you. **Write one even when the work shipped inside a PR raised for
  something else.** Fifteen rows above cite only PRs or commits, and
  several are *unverified* because nothing named the note.
- Refer to any note by its bare filename, never by a path. The
  dangling-pointer test resolves names across the tree
  (`DESIGN-NOTES-MOVE-IMPLEMENTED.md`).
- `TIMELINE.md` is the coordinator's. It gets one line per designer note
  when the note merges, and the designer doesn't write it.
- **Attribute decisions by role, not by first name**, using the greppable
  callout `**Decision (project owner, <date>):** ...` (root `CLAUDE.md`).
- **A designer ruling can be wrong.** Six were on the record by 09-17: the
  greyed `Find repos` tab, port scarcity, the `SoftwareLibrary` type,
  `lines_of_code`, the stale ports board rows, and a retraction the owner
  had already ruled out. Each was caught by measuring against the code. Since
  then the corrections have mostly run the other way: asks whose premise
  the code contradicted (one mechanism for work lists and investigations,
  a derived INBOX, a repo-only discovery pane). Measuring is still the
  fastest correction path, so the errors stay in the ledger where they can
  be read rather than being tidied out.
