# On laz: the web app is the python child of `dotenv ... run -- resource-explorer web --port 8813`, the worker
# the python child of `dotenv ... run -- prefect worker start` (pgrep -fl to find both). Exit 0 when the two
# carry the same names with the same values, apart from the names listed in RE_PARITY_IGNORE (space separated;
# default: the ones that are meant to differ between a web app and a worker).
# Limitation: `ps eww` splits on spaces, so a value containing a space is fingerprinted by its first word.
