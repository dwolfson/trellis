"""Generate all of RE's repo Survey Definition Dr.Egeria docs from repo's own
STEP_REGISTRY — reproducible artifacts that publish repo analysis steps as
real GovernanceActionProcessStep elements and chain them into runnable
Survey Definitions, one per UI surface (survey_kind).

Analysis-step Egeria registration plan, D1-D3
(docs/analysis-step-egeria-registration-plan.md), extended per
docs/discovery-automate-project-context-plan.md Part 1 to generate three
separate Survey Definitions instead of one, each tagged with a survey_kind
Additional Property so Discovery's candidate list doesn't show the
Automate-tier "run everything" bundle (and vice versa):

- **scouting**  — "Repo Coarse Scout": the fast, GitHub-API-only pair
  (repo_health, repo_language) — re-authored here because the original
  live Egeria element was lost to a database reset and never recreated
  (confirmed missing via a live probe before this script was written).
- **discovery** — "Repo Discovery Survey": early-headlights signals from
  data already collected, no new fetch. Currently just
  repo_license_classification (a real, currently-available "should we
  pursue this" signal) — deliberately a minimal, honest interim set;
  grows once Part 2's new Discovery-tier analyses (maturity, security
  policy heuristic, deployment/Docker evidence, etc.) are built.
- **automate_full** — "Repo Full Survey": every current STEP_REGISTRY
  step, chained — the comprehensive bundle for an already-tracked
  resource, not Discovery's launch target. Re-tags the exact same
  qualified_name as before (upsert=true on Create Governance Action
  Process means re-running this in Egeria updates the existing element
  in place, not a duplicate) — only its Additional Properties gain the
  new survey_kind tag.

Run this whenever STEP_REGISTRY changes (a step added/removed/re-described),
then execute the regenerated doc(s) against Egeria to keep Discovery/
Scouting/Automate's candidate lists in sync. IMPORTANT: after executing a
regenerated doc against an *already-linked* process (i.e. every time except
the very first authoring), run
`uv run python scripts/reconcile_survey_definition_links.py` afterward —
Dr.Egeria's "Link First/Next Process Step" commands are not idempotent and
will duplicate or leave stale the step-to-step links, which makes
SurveyDefinitionReader see "branching" and refuse to run the Survey
Definition at all (a real live incident, 2026-08-13 — see that script's and
survey_definition_reconciler.py's docstrings for the full story).

Also emits one "Link Element To Scope" ScopedBy block per Question each
generated Survey Definition answers (docs/survey-question-context-plan.md
D1) — the join is: each step_key's containing analysis_catalog id (via
REPO_ANALYSIS_STEP_MAP) cross-referenced against question_catalog.yaml's
per-question answering.analysis_ids. Run docs/dr-egeria/foundations.md and
docs/dr-egeria/scouting-questions.md (or their generated equivalents)
first — the Question terms these blocks reference by name must already
exist in Egeria before this doc is executed.

This is the one resource-type-specific piece of the mechanism — everything
it calls (resource_explorer.surveyors.dr_egeria_survey_publisher) is
resource-type-agnostic, so a future database/filesystem equivalent of this
script just needs its own PublishableStep list(s) built from whatever
registry that resource type uses (neither has a STEP_REGISTRY-shaped
registry today — see the plan doc's D1 for why repo went first).

D3 (docs/repo-survey-catalog-completion-plan.md): SPECS is now parsed from
docs/dr-egeria/repo_survey_types.csv instead of being a Python literal —
the primary Survey Type authoring mechanism, matching the precedent
docs/dr-egeria/resource_questions.csv already set for Questions. One row
per (survey, step) pair, grouped by (survey_kind, survey_group) and
ordered by step_order. A single row with step_key "*" means "every
current STEP_REGISTRY step, in STEP_REGISTRY's own order" — used for
"Repo Full Survey" specifically so it stays automatically complete by
construction (this is NOT just cosmetic: before this change, "Full
Survey"'s step_keys was already `list(STEP_REGISTRY.keys())` in code, but
the generated *doc on disk* had gone stale and silently dropped
repo_symbol_extraction after it was added — regenerating always would
have caught this immediately; converting "*" into an explicit hand-listed
CSV row-list would have reintroduced exactly that failure mode for the
next step added later, so it stays a sentinel instead).
