"""The Architecture IR — design doc §5.3.

A normalised intermediate representation produced BEFORE any Egeria write.
Everything downstream (projection, curation, drift, scoring) reads this, which
is what makes re-derivation and re-publication separable operations and lets
the whole spike be tested without an Egeria server.

Phase 0 also treats the IR as a hypothesis under test: if it cannot represent
what the detectors found, §5.3 needs revising before Phase 1. Deliberately
kept close to what §5.4 and §8.2 specify rather than inventing convenience
fields — a field the design doc does not name is a finding to report, not a
field to quietly add.
