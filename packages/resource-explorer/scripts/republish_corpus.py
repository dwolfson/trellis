"""Republish RE's corpus to Egeria, one repo at a time, resumably.

Written after 2026-09-02, when an unguarded version of this stalled the Egeria
platform four repos in (5.48 GiB of a 6 GiB cap, 356% CPU) and recorded the
repo it half-published as a success. Both of those are addressed here, and
neither was a subtle failure — they were simply not looked for.

  python scripts/republish_corpus.py --dry-run
  python scripts/republish_corpus.py --limit 5
  python scripts/republish_corpus.py            # everything not already done

Progress is appended to the state file as each repo finishes, so a kill leaves
a usable record and a rerun skips what succeeded.
