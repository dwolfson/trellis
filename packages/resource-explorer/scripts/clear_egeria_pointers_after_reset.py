"""Clear Resource Explorer's Egeria POINTERS after the owner resets Egeria's metadata database, and keep its
DECISIONS and HISTORY.

Architect's rule (2026-10-08): clear pointers, keep decisions and history. One guarded script, dry-run first,
DDL-free. NOT the per-repository "Forget Egeria links" button (29 presses, and it also drops survey history).

DEFAULT IS A DRY RUN: it prints, per table, what it would clear or mark, writes NOTHING to the registry, writes
a plan file (JSON, no credentials) and prints the plan's hash.

    cd packages/resource-explorer
    REGISTRY_DATABASE_URL=... uv run python scripts/clear_egeria_pointers_after_reset.py \\
        --reset-at 2026-10-08T18:30Z [--old-collection-id X --new-collection-id Y]

Run it THROUGH `uv run`, from packages/resource-explorer. A bare `python scripts/...` fails with
ModuleNotFoundError on the resource_explorer import (catalogue_commit): run it through uv run so the
resource_explorer package is importable.

The owner's run sequence: (1) the dry run; (2) read the header's schema and current_schema line; (3) apply, with
the exact "to apply:" line it printed; (4) read the snapshot's recorded current_schema; (5) a second dry run,
which must be empty. The markers' collection ids read "unknown → unknown" until the metadataCollectionId slice
lands: that is expected and honest, not a fault.

APPLY needs ALL of these, and refuses (exit 2, saying which) when any is missing or false:

    --apply  --plan-file <the dry run's file>  --plan-hash <hash it printed>
    --database <name>              the registry database name, passed again; must equal the one in
                                   REGISTRY_DATABASE_URL
    --schema <name>                the schema from that URL's ?options=-csearch_path=..., passed again (a
                                   Postgres URL with none is refused, dry run and apply; on SQLite the schema is
                                   'main' and the flag is optional, or must equal 'main')
    --cleared-by <who>/<UTC>       e.g. dwolfson/2026-10-08T19:05Z; recorded in an activity_log row
    and: the plan file is recent (--max-plan-age-minutes, default 15) and was made for this database; the plan
    recomputed from the live data now has the SAME hash (anything that changed since the dry run refuses); no
    RE process looks active (activity_log rows still 'running' whose owner is alive or cannot be judged, runs
    claimed or running, outbox rows running).

What it does (all its writes are in RE's registry; no DDL; no proof row is ever deleted or edited):

  KEEP a pointer that still resolves (owner's decision 2026-11-13, after the 11-11 recovery's dry run found three
        live pointers it would have blanked). Before planning to clear or remove a row, the script reads each of its
        Egeria GUIDs BY GUID, as RE's service account (the daemon identity the re-attach tool uses). Its only
        Egeria calls are those reads; it never writes to Egeria. Per row:
          - every GUID is GONE (Egeria says not found)  -> the row is cleared or removed as below;
          - any GUID RESOLVES                           -> the row is KEPT: "keep: live, created <time>";
          - any GUID cannot be READ (refused, unreachable, an unexpected answer) -> the row is KEPT: "keep:
            unreadable (<why>): not treated as gone". An unread pointer is never taken for a dead one.
        The kept rows, their reason and what each GUID answered are in the plan, so in its hash: an answer that
        changes between the dry run and the apply refuses the apply like any other change. A resource with a
        kept publish pointer (its asset, sub-resource or report GUID) gets no egeria_reset marker. Checked: the
        pointer columns below, the app_settings GUID keys (egeria.github_source_control_library_guid,
        egeria_server_guid::*, egeria_asset_guid::*) and the cache rows that hold a GUID (the materialized
        architecture rows, survey_definition_cache). Not checked: egeria_linkage_status (it records that a GUID
        was found stale, it is not a pointer RE follows) and the claim/credential settings (their values are not
        GUIDs). If Egeria cannot be reached at all the run REFUSES rather than planning without the reads.

  CLEAR a pointer column (row kept):      projects/databases/file_systems.egeria_asset_guid, sub_resources.egeria_guid,
        investigations.egeria_project_guid (+ egeria_project_status becomes `unbound`, only for rows that were
        `linked`), entity_egeria_project_context.egeria_project_guid (+ status becomes the VALUE `unbound`;
        "unbound by reset · rebind to recreate" is display text only, and a publish is gated on it as on `unset`), working_sets.egeria_collection_guid, work_lists.egeria_guid + published_at,
        doc_sources (2 guids), rfa_actions (2 guids), and the report-guid column of the publish-state tables
        (database_surveys, filesystem_surveys, project_egeria_surveys, project_published_analyses,
        project_published_annotation_types). The rows, their times and who made them stay.
  REMOVE rows that only cache an Egeria element: architecture_materialized_blueprints / _components / _ports,
        survey_definition_cache, egeria_linkage_status, and the app_settings keys egeria_register_claim::*,
        egeria_server_claim::*, egeria_server_unconfirmed::*, egeria.github_source_control_library_guid.
  OUTBOX: rows that are not terminal (not done, dead, superseded or cancelled) become 'superseded' with the
        reason "Egeria reset <when>". 'done' rows are kept untouched; 'dead' rows are left 'dead' (listed as
        "dead before the reset · untouched").
  MARKERS: ONE catalogue_commit_proofs row per resource that has proofs or a "Published" badge row (a badge-only
        marker says "published claim before the reset (no proof rows)": a project_published_* row is a CLAIM that
        a publish happened, not proof the resource was in Egeria, so the badge may say "published earlier" for
        one that was already gone; it re-compares at read time, and the wording says what it rests on), proof kind 'egeria_reset', read_at = the
        reset time, text "Egeria reset <when> · old collection id → new". Status derives from it (see
        catalogue_commit.derive_commit_state).

KEPT ON PURPOSE: the qualified-name mirrors (investigations.egeria_project_qualified_name,
working_sets.egeria_collection_qualified_name, entity_egeria_project_context.egeria_project_qualified_name). A
rebind recreates the Egeria project or collection under the SAME name (architect's ruling), so the name is the
decision and only the GUID is the pointer. Status VALUES are not this script's business beyond what is written
here; the stacked branch that owns the status vocabulary decides them.

ORDER: the egeria_reset markers are written FIRST. They are INSERT-only and idempotent, so if a later group
fails the screens already say "Egeria was reset" instead of showing cleared pointers with no explanation; a
re-run (after a fresh dry run) skips the markers already there and finishes the rest. A failure names the failing
group and the groups that had committed, and prints no traceback.

--skip-missing-table work_lists: work_lists is created lazily by its own module, so on a fresh schema it may not
exist. The run refuses by default; the flag skips it (only if it is really missing), and the skip is recorded in
the plan (so the hash), the dry-run text and the activity row.

KEPT UNTOUCHED: every proof row, verdicts, both scope tables, enrichment and answers, journal,
reclassifications, groups, work list members, native_survey_annotations (GUIDs included: they are measurements
read at a time), step_runs (their survey_report_guid keys those annotations), survey history, findings,
metrics, activity history, feedback (its element_guid is an answer key, not an Egeria GUID).

A snapshot of every row it will change is written (mode 0600) BEFORE the first change. Each table group is one
transaction with rollback on any error. A second run finds nothing to clear and writes no second marker.
