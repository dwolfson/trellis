"""Do the 12 Perspectives from foundations.md exist in live Egeria?

`docs/open-stack-checklist.md` §7 gives three post-redeploy checks — questions
resolve, no duplicate/stale links, both surveys load — and **none of them looks
at Perspectives**. They are authored by `docs/dr-egeria/foundations/foundations.md`
in the same batch as the glossary and funnel stages, so a heal that reports
success can leave them missing exactly the way 8 of 49 questions went missing on
2026-08-31.

**Compared against the generative source, not a snapshot.**
`docs/egeria-redeploy-baseline-2026-08-26.json` records 12 perspectives and was
verified identical to foundations.md on 2026-08-31 — so the snapshot adds
nothing the repo does not already hold, and a generator says what SHOULD be
there where a snapshot only says what once was.

    uv run python scripts/verify_perspectives.py

Exit codes: 0 all present · 1 some missing · 2 could not determine.

**UNREACHABLE IS NOT MISSING, and that distinction is the point of this file.**
Written while the platform was down for a redeploy, so it has never been
exercised against a live server and its first real run is the post-redeploy
verification itself. A check that cannot tell "the platform is not answering"
from "the perspectives are gone" would report 0/12 at precisely the moment that
reads as catastrophe — so a connection failure exits 2 and says so, and only a
definite not-found counts as missing.
