# Idempotent local Prefect startup: server + work pool + deployment + worker.
#
# Nothing auto-starts these after a reboot (there's no launchd/systemd unit —
# deliberately not built here, see the note at the bottom) — this script is
# the "one command to bring Prefect back up" the CLAUDE.md docs point at.
# Safe to run repeatedly: each step checks whether it's already done before
# doing it, so `make prefect-up` after a reboot and `make prefect-up` while
# everything's already running both just work.
#
# State lives in .prefect-run/ (gitignored) — PID files so `prefect_down.sh`
# can find exactly what this script started, and log files so a background
# `prefect server`/`worker` doesn't dump into whichever terminal happened to
# start it once and then vanish when that terminal closes.

# Not a launchd/systemd unit, and not a container: this is a bare-host
# dev-local convenience script, not RE's likely long-term answer. RE (like
# the rest of Trellis) is expected to be containerized eventually, and
# Prefect already publishes an official image (prefecthq/prefect) nobody's
# using yet — that's almost certainly where "start it after a reboot"
# should actually live (docker-compose, restart:always), not a bespoke
# pidfile script. This exists because that containerization hasn't happened
# yet, not as a design decision to keep bare-host processes long-term. Also
# not something RE depends on being always-up regardless of packaging —
# PREFECT_ENABLED=true degrades to running steps locally with no server at
# all (see prefect_adapter.py) — so this is about convenience, not liveness.
