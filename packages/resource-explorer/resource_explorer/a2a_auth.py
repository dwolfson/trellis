"""Authentication for the `a2a` process role.

`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §2 says the A2A surface "has **no
authentication at all** today"; §4 ("Authentication: two paths, one token")
says both ways into a trellis app must end in the same thing — *a per-request
pyegeria client holding an Egeria bearer token for the actual user*. This
module is that rule applied to agent-to-agent traffic.

Two accepted credentials, one header
------------------------------------
Every call carries ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``. The token is either

* **a trellis app JWT** — minted by ``trellis_auth.create_access_token`` from
  either login path (direct password exchange, or Portal SSO). It is HS256 and
  we hold the secret, so verifying it is local and free; the caller's Egeria
  bearer token rides inside it as the ``egeria_token`` claim.
* **a raw Egeria bearer token** — what the Portal already holds, and what an
  external orchestrator that talks to Egeria directly already has. We do not
  hold Egeria's signing key, so the only honest check is to *use* it:
  ``trellis_auth.validate_egeria_token`` makes one cheap authenticated call
  (``get_my_profile``) against the view server.

The app JWT is tried first because it is the cheap one and it cannot be
mistaken for the other: a token that verifies under our own HS256 secret was
issued by us.

Why the Egeria path is cached
-----------------------------
Validation is a network round trip to the view server. An A2A conversation is
many calls under one token (send, poll the task, subscribe), so validating per
request would multiply every agent call by an Egeria call. The cache is keyed
on the token itself and expires **with the token**: an Egeria bearer token is
an RS256 JWT carrying its own ``exp`` (one hour, measured — see
``trellis_auth.EGERIA_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS_OBSERVED``), so a cache entry can be
held exactly as long as the credential it describes is valid and no longer.
An opaque token with no readable ``exp`` falls back to a short TTL rather than
being cached forever.

Only *successful* validations are cached. A rejection is not cached at all: a
token can go from invalid to valid (Egeria was briefly down, the user was just
granted access) and caching "no" would pin a transient failure for an hour,
which is the failure mode that is hard to diagnose from the outside.

What the caller's identity is *for*
-----------------------------------
`current_caller` is a ContextVar, set by the middleware for the duration of the
request and inherited by every task and thread the request spawns — the same
shape the Portal uses (``egeria_auth.py``'s contextvar middleware) so both
sides look alike. `apply_caller_token(client)` is the downstream half: build a
pyegeria client, hand it the caller's token, and the Egeria write is attributed
to the person rather than to `erinoverview`.

**Scope note.** This module makes the caller's token *available* to agent code.
It does not rewrite RE's existing pyegeria client construction sites, which
still build service-account clients — that is RE's trellis-auth adoption (plan
§4, "Isolation matrix"), a larger change than the A2A role, and deliberately
not attempted here. Until it lands, an A2A call is authenticated but its Egeria
writes are still attributed to the service account.
