"""
Externalized analysis catalog — the menu of analyses available per resource
type — loaded from config/analysis_catalog.yaml, so adding, retagging, or
reclassifying an analysis is a config change, not a code change here.

See that file's header comment for the schema and the 7-intent scheme.

This module also owns the (optional, fail-soft) live merge with Egeria's own
Technology Type catalog: get_analyses() can append Egeria-native entries
(via EgeriaTechTypeCatalog.get_produced_annotation_types()) alongside the
local YAML ones. If Egeria is unreachable, only the local entries are
returned — never block or error the whole panel on a live-Egeria failure.
