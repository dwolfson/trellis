"""The survey a person decides on: the latest completed survey of a repository, kept per step.

Brief section 1 (project owner, 2026-10-07): "we shouldn't have to survey again before publishing; we
are asking the user to make decisions on what has already been surveyed, not what the current state
is." A publish therefore publishes the survey that already exists. Until now no such thing existed to
publish: `SurveyOrchestrator.run` returned a `SurveyResult` in memory, the findings tables kept lossy
rows, and the only way to get annotations in front of `EgeriaPublisher` was to run the survey again.

So the orchestrator keeps each step's annotations when the step completes, and this module reads them
back as the survey a publish sends. **No schema change:** the rows live in `app_settings` (key/value),
one per step, plus one small index per repository:

    repo_survey_step::<slug>::<step_key>   {"surveyed_at", "step", "annotations": [...]}
    repo_survey_index::<slug>              {"<step_key>": "<surveyed_at>", ...}

Per step, because surveys are run in parts (an Analyses-card "run", a definition, a scheduled step):
the latest completed survey is the newest result of EACH step, and `surveyed_at` of the whole is the
newest of them. A step that failed or was skipped keeps its previous result; it is never overwritten by
an absence. A step that ran and found nothing is recorded as an EMPTY result (ran, nothing found), which
is a different statement from "never ran" (no row).

Annotations are stored as the dataclass fields they were built with. JSON cannot carry everything a
surveyor might put in a `json_properties` dict; anything it cannot encode is stored as its `str()`, which
is what the publisher would send for it anyway (`to_string_map`).
