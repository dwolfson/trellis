"""Survey Definition step-link reconciliation — docs/survey-question-context-plan.md
follow-up, born from a real live incident (2026-08-13).

Dr.Egeria's "Link First/Next Process Step" commands are NOT idempotent —
unlike "Create/Update Governance Action Process(Step)" (which merge-update
by qualified_name), re-running a Survey Definition's generated markdown
against an already-linked process creates a *brand new* NextProcessStep
relationship alongside the existing one, rather than replacing it. Left
unreconciled, a step ends up with more than one outgoing edge, and
SurveyDefinitionReader._parse_graph() correctly refuses to guess which one
is real — it raises UnsupportedSurveyDefinitionError ("branching ... not
supported"). That's the exact incident that surfaced this: regenerating
docs/dr-egeria/repo-survey-definition-*.md to add D1's ScopedBy Question
links (docs/survey-question-context-plan.md) meant re-running the *whole*
doc, including the pre-existing Link Next Process Step commands, which
duplicated every existing edge across all three repo Survey Definitions (1,
2, and 27 duplicate edges respectively). Repo Full Survey also had one
genuinely stale edge — repo_ci_quality -> repo_api_structure — left over
from before repo_maturity/repo_conventions were inserted into the chain by
an earlier change; a duplicate and a stale edge look identical to the
reader (a step with >1 outgoing edge), so both need reconciling the same
way.

This module is the pure, side-effect-free diff logic (the unit-testable
seam, matching survey_definition_reader.py's own _parse_graph convention)
— it decides *what* to delete. SurveyDefinitionReader.reconcile_step_links()
does the actual fetch + delete against live Egeria.

## Scope-link reconciliation (docs/Backlog.md, "Superseded Question term",
2026-09-13) — a sibling pass to the step-edge one above, same shape (pure
diff here, live fetch+write in the script/reader), but a different
relationship: `ScopedBy`, not `NextGovernanceActionProcessStep`. Two live
incidents motivate it:

  * 2026-08-19 — the questions batch ran after the survey-definitions batch
    once, so every `Link Element To Scope` command reported success against
    Question terms that did not exist yet, and created nothing. The
    definition's own canary was present throughout; only the scoped
    candidate lookup silently returned empty.
  * 2026-09-13 — "What is its internal architecture...?" was split into four
    questions in the CSV; the old term's `ScopedBy` links from
    RepoFullSurvey and RepoArchitectureDiscovery were never removed when the
    replacement links were added, so both definitions stayed scoped to a
    term the authored document no longer names.

Neither incident produces a "branching" symptom the step-edge reconciler can
see — `ScopedBy` isn't `NextGovernanceActionProcessStep`, and nothing about a
missing or extra scope link makes `SurveyDefinitionReader.fetch()` raise.
The definition just quietly answers the wrong (or fewer) questions. See
`expected_scopes_from_document()` / `diff_scopes()` below and
`scripts/reconcile_survey_definition_scopes.py`.
