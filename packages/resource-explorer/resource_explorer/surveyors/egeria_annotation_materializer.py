"""Bring annotations produced BY Egeria into Resource Explorer's own tables.

The direction every other piece of this codebase runs is RE -> Egeria: a
surveyor produces annotations locally and EgeriaPublisher writes them out. A
Survey Definition whose steps execute natively in Egeria inverts that — the
annotations are created in Egeria and RE never sees them, so its Results views,
trend charts and question-answering have nothing to read.

This closes that direction by materializing them into `project_analysis_findings`
(and `project_analysis_metrics` for numeric ones), which is what every existing
Results renderer already reads. Nothing downstream needs to know a finding came
from Egeria rather than from a local surveyor — except that it is recorded, on
every row, because a number whose provenance is unclear is the thing this
codebase keeps having to un-confuse.

Two deliberate constraints:

* Annotations are fetched **by relationship** — `get_new_annotations(report_guid)`,
  which walks the report's own annotation links — never by qualifiedName prefix.
  EgeriaReader's existing `get_annotations()` searches `Annotation::{slug}::{ts}::`,
  which is RE's OWN naming convention; a natively-produced annotation does not
  carry it and would silently not be found.

  Measured against a real published report (b5ccdfd1, egeria_git):
  `get_annotations_for_element` returns "No elements found" for both the report
  GUID and the asset GUID, while `get_new_annotations` returns the annotation.
  The first was the obvious-sounding call and is the wrong one.

* Materializing is **append-only and idempotent per report**. A report already
  materialized is skipped rather than re-inserted, because these tables are
  append-only history: running twice would double every count read off them.

* Reports **Resource Explorer itself published** are skipped. Their annotations
  came from a local run whose findings are already in these tables, so
  importing them writes a second copy of the same run — and because the copy
  carries the REPORT's timestamp while the original carries the run's, the two
  land milliseconds apart under the same kind, and `query_metrics` "latest run"
  then picks between them by accident. Caught on real data: materializing
  egeria_git's only report produced 12 metric rows at ...442655 shadowed by the
  local run's 5 at ...448468.

Status: no Survey Definition currently has a natively-executing step (measured
2026-08-26 — all 8 definitions, 71 steps, executes_at=resource-explorer), so
this path is exercised by tests and not yet by live data. It is written to be
correct when native steps are authored, and says so rather than implying it has
been proven end to end.
