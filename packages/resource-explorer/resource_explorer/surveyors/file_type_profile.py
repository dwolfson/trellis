"""File types and file counts as Egeria's own folder-survey annotations.

Ruling 2026-10-07 (DESIGN-FILE-TYPES-AS-ANNOTATIONS.md): a file type is a MEASUREMENT, published as
profile annotations in the survey report under Egeria's names, verbatim, never as a DataSet per type.

    Capture File Counts      ResourceMeasureAnnotation   files, directories, distinct extensions, types
    Profile File Extensions  ResourceProfileAnnotation   count per extension
    Profile File Types       ResourceProfileAnnotation   count per file type (resolve_technology_type)
    Profile Asset Types      ResourceProfileAnnotation   what cataloging the SELECTED items would create
    Profile File Names to External Log  ResourceProfileLogAnnotation  only when a person asks, a CSV (never default)

Every count here comes from `project_file_inventory`, the table the inventory step refreshes, so the
profile equals the inventory by construction. The envelope (resultState, measuredAt, producingRun,
scope) rides in `additionalProperties`, which Egeria's own types do not carry.
