"""Shared IR -> registry persistence for the two architecture-recovery
survey steps (repo_arch_detect, repo_arch_coupling — Phase 1 plan §4.2).

Design doc §5.4/§6.0: no new table. Evidence goes to
`project_analysis_findings` with `kind="architecture_recovery"`; a
component-scoped measure goes to `project_analysis_metrics` under the same
kind. `scope_locator` is the join key in both, and it IS the component — a
component's path prefix (§6.0), derived here from its `files` glob (or, for
a files-less deployment/compose component, its declared deployment
context) rather than its `slug`, which is a detector-qualified identifier
and not itself a path.

Both survey steps call `persist_ir()` independently (they run as separate
StepInfo entries, possibly at different times — see
ProjectRegistry.query_findings_all_runs' docstring for why that matters).
There is no cross-step merge here the way scripts/arch-spike/detect.py's
`_merge_agreeing()` does it for a single combined run: instead, two
components that land on the SAME scope_locator naturally accumulate
multiple "component" and evidence rows over time, and the results reader
(repo_survey_definition_adapter.py's `_architecture_recovery_results`)
reads them back together. That is a deliberate simplification, not an
oversight — see the port's write-up for the trade.

#: make it return exactly one row — a Mermaid blob — and **suppress that
#: fallback**, replacing the architecture section with a picture drawn for a
