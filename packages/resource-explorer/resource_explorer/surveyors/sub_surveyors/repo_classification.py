"""Sub-surveyor: what the repo *represents*, and where its expected artifacts are.

Design reference: `docs/architecture-recovery-design.md` §5.5b. This wires the
three library modules built for it into a runnable survey step:

    github/repo_role.py      -> what kind of thing is this repo (7 roles, ranked)
    github/doc_locations.py  -> where does each artifact actually live
    github/expectations.py   -> what should a project of this kind have, + the gate

**Why this is Discovery-tier and not Assessment.** It answers "is the expensive
work worth doing at all", which is the funnel's own question (CLAUDE.md rule 17).
Its most valuable output is a *negative*: on a tutorial or samples repo with no
structural evidence, architecture recovery should not run at all. §5.5b is
explicit that this is a **gate, not a weighting** — the cost saved is the whole
tier, not a filter applied after the expensive work already happened.

**The gate keys on containment, not on the primary role.** `odpi/egeria-workspaces`
ranks `tutorial` primary — its README says "designed for learning", and it holds
37 notebooks — *and* it is architecture-recovery target T1, which scored 18/27.
A gate reading the primary role would skip the repo we have recovered most
successfully. See `expectations.recovery_gate`.

**No score is emitted, deliberately.** §5.5a(c)/§5.5b: a checklist becomes a
maturity score, and a maturity score punishes deliberate choices — a small stable
library documents lightly on purpose. This step reports located artifacts, absent
ones, and *confirmations* (absences that support the role, e.g. a library having
no deployment artifacts, which `trellis.md` records verbatim). It emits no count,
percentage or grade.

**Resolved: a skip is not a sixth outcome.** This module originally recorded the
gate as a bare finding because none of `step_outcome.py`'s five labels fits "we
deliberately did not run because it would have been the wrong question" —
`no_signal` requires `known_positive=True` and nothing ran, and `unverified`
means *could not* run when in fact we could and chose not to.

The owner of that module resolved it one layer up rather than by adding a label,
and the reasoning is worth keeping: the five describe what a run **achieved**,
and a skip is the absence of a run, so adding it would have weakened the other
five. `surveyors/result_status.py` carries a reader-facing vocabulary instead —
a run asks *"is my zero provable?"*, a reader asks *"what should I do about
it?"*, and those group differently. `rs.skipped(reason, gate=...)` takes the
reason as a **required** argument, because a skip with no stated reason renders
identically to a failure. We pass `recovery_gate`'s own reason string through
verbatim: the whole value of the design is that the card can say *why* this
repo was skipped, and a generic "gate declined" would waste it.
