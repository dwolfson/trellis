"""Sub-surveyor: what can you talk to, and is the contract written down?

Answers two of the questions in the catalog from data already collected — the
file inventory, the parsed dependencies, and (new, §6 of
`SPEC-ACTIONABLE-AND-HONEST.md`) the two other walks that already know facts
this one used to ignore: `distribution` findings (repo_manifest_parse's
DistributionParser — `[project.scripts]`/`package.json bin`) and
`deployment_evidence` findings (a `__main__.py` under the distribution's own
package). No fetch either way — everything here is a second READ of a table
another step already wrote, never a second parse of the manifest itself.

    "What kind of interfaces does it have?"  -> the interface kinds below
    "Is there a published API?"              -> the `published_spec` finding

One analysis rather than two, because the second is a finding ABOUT the
first: a library with 171 exported symbols has an interface surface and no
published contract, and answering those separately would mean re-deriving
the same evidence twice and letting the two disagree.

**Three rungs, not two — the vendored-rule defect one analytic over.** The
old two-rung ladder ("specified" / "implied") put almost everything on the
wrong rung: a `[project.scripts]` entry point IS the CLI, not a hint of one,
and the old code answered "cli — implied. Depends on click" for a repo whose
own manifest names the entry point — a fact `repo_role.py`,
`distribution_parser.py` ("the CLI entry point as a fact"), and
`deployment_evidence.py` (#94, a console entry point is the strongest signal)
already knew and this file never read. That is the same shape as the
vendored-walk defect: a fact known by one walk and not read by another,
producing a confident sentence the repository itself contradicts.

  declared     a contract committed in the repo (openapi.yaml, .proto, …),
               OR an entry point the packaging declares
               ([project.scripts]/package.json bin) — read from the SAME
               `distribution` finding rows deployment_evidence.py reads,
               never a second parse of pyproject.toml/package.json.
  implemented  the interface exists in the code whether or not anything
               documents it. From stored evidence when it exists — a
               `__main__.py` under the distribution's own package
               (deployment_evidence's `dunder_main` evidence, itself
               path-only, no content read) is implemented-CLI evidence with
               no declared entry point. For the five route-like kinds
               (http_api, grpc, graphql, messaging, soap), evidence is read
               from `project_code_markers` — decorator/annotation
               registrations `repo_symbol_extraction` records for Python and
               Java (DESIGN-INTERFACE-SURFACE-IMPLEMENTED-RUNG.md) — and,
               as a secondary source, `architecture_interfaces` port
               findings (`arch_recovery`'s FastAPI route count). Both are
               reads of rows another step already wrote — never a second
               fetch or a second parse — same shape as `distribution`/
               `deployment_evidence` above. Where neither source has a row
               for this repo (`repo_symbol_extraction` has not run, or its
               languages are outside marker coverage), the rung is reported
               `could_not_check` with the reason, and the finding SAYS SO
               rather than silently guessing `implied`. Where the capture
               HAS run and covered a marker-capable language but found no
               registration for a kind, that is a real measured zero, not a
               could_not_check.
  implied      a dependency suggests an interface and nothing confirms it —
               and only reached when neither higher rung applies for that
               interface kind.

Measured across the catalog on 2026-08-26 to ground the detection rather than
guess at it: 9 openapi/swagger files across 4 repos, 32 .proto across 4, 2
GraphQL schemas across 2 — while 17 repos depend on an HTTP framework and 22 on
a CLI framework. The two sources disagree far more often than they overlap,
which is exactly why they are not merged into one verdict.
