"""Sub-surveyor: File Inventory → ResourceMeasureAnnotation.

Closes the same class of bug D5 closed for `project_code_symbols`, on the
table that far more steps depend on. `project_file_inventory` was written by
exactly three things — full RAG ingestion, IncrementalIndexer, and
IngestionPipeline.refresh_profile() (the scheduler's profile job) —
and by no survey step at all. Meanwhile `repo_file_structure`, `repo_language`,
`repo_file_classification`, `repo_file_size`, `repo_documentation` and
`repo_sub_resource_survey` all *read* it.

The practical effect was that "Coarse Profile Survey" did not do what its own
description promises. Of its four steps only `repo_data_profiling` acquired the
zipball; the other three reported whatever the inventory happened to hold from
some earlier, unrelated run. Survey a repo that has changed since it was last
ingested and it reports the previous file structure, language shape and
classification, with nothing indicating the data is stale. A repo registered
without RAG ingestion at all (the org-import/discovery path deliberately skips
it — see org_importer.py) had no self-healing path whatsoever: its inventory
stayed empty and every dependent step reported nothing forever.
DataProfilerSurveyor's own "project_file_inventory is empty. File inventory is
populated ..." message was the visible edge of exactly this.

Same self-contained microflow shape as SymbolExtractionSurveyor: acquire the
shared zipball_root resource (D6), refresh the table (write), then report what
it just wrote (read). Because `resolve_resources` guarantees one download per
SurveyOrchestrator.run() no matter how many selected steps declare
`requires_resources={"zipball_root": ...}`, adding this step costs no extra
network call in any survey that already contains a zipball-using step — it
shares the same extraction root as repo_data_profiling and
repo_symbol_extraction.

Ordering matters and is enforced by position in STEP_REGISTRY (which is also
the order "Repo Full Survey" runs, via the "*" sentinel in
repo_survey_types.csv): this step must precede every step that reads the
inventory, or the run refreshes the table only after its consumers have already
read the stale copy.

The write itself delegates to IngestionPipeline._store_file_inventory rather
than reimplementing the walk — one implementation of "what counts as a file in
this repo", shared with ingestion and refresh_profile.
