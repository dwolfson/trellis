#: Languages whose symbol extractor actually captures documentation.
#:
#: go_symbol_extractor.py and js_symbol_extractor.py hardcode `docstring=""`
#: at every assignment site (3 and 4 respectively). Measured 2026-09-01 over
#: the whole symbol table: go 0 of 70,955, javascript 0 of 48,533 — against
#: java 60,437 of 203,521 and python 54,985 of 114,055.
#:
#: Go has doc comments and JavaScript has JSDoc. Both exist in the language;
#: neither is extracted. So a coverage figure for those languages would be a
#: fact about OUR extractor wearing the clothes of a fact about THEIR code —
#: and it would come out as 0%, the most alarming value available, not the
#: quietest. Refusing to report is the only honest option until the
#: extractors are taught to read them.
