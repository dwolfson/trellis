# Symbol kinds treated as public API surface
#: Languages whose symbol extractor actually computes cyclomatic complexity.
#:
#: go_symbol_extractor.py and js_symbol_extractor.py contain NO `complexity=`
#: assignment at all, so every row they write defaults to 0. Measured over the
#: live symbol table 2026-09-01, functions and methods only:
#:
#:     java        179,668  min 1  max 348  avg 1.59  55 distinct values
#:     python       97,833  min 1  max 186  avg 2.64  84 distinct values
#:     go           62,403  min 0  max   0  avg 0.00   1 distinct value
#:     javascript   35,764  min 0  max   0  avg 0.00   1 distinct value
#:
#: A stored 0 here means "never measured", not "trivially simple", and the two
#: are indistinguishable once averaged: an aggregate across all four languages
#: is dragged toward zero by 98,167 symbols nobody computed. Same gap, same two
#: languages, as _DOCSTRING_CAPABLE_LANGUAGES in documentation.py — and it was
#: nearly missed here because `COUNT(*) WHERE complexity IS NOT NULL` counts a
#: zero as populated.

    surveyor is already in SurveyOrchestrator.run()'s fixed sub-surveyor list,
