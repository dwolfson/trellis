    Checks indexed file paths for the presence of security, CI, and license

    Renamed from "SecuritySurveyor" — that name implied real security
    scanning (secrets, CVEs, SAST), but this only ever checked 3 hygiene
    artifacts (SECURITY.md, CI config, license presence), matching its own
    STEP = "SecurityHygieneCheck". The rename frees "security" as a family
    name for future analyses that do real scanning (secret detection,
    dependency-vulnerability/CVE checks, SAST, branch-protection audits) —
    see repo_survey_definition_adapter.py's ANALYSIS_KINDS registry,
    `family="security"`. Identifiers (analysis_catalog id "security_scan",
    step key "repo_security") deliberately did NOT change — only the
    Python class/file name, to avoid breaking existing schedules/data.
