"""Sub-surveyor: what a refresh would actually need to do — a PLANNER.

The mirror of `security_summary`. That one sits at the END of a survey and reads
what the other steps wrote; this sits at the FRONT and reads stored *state* to
say what the rest of the run needs. Same mechanism, opposite direction — see
`docs/survey-composition-and-topic-summary-design.md` §2b.

**It is advisory in this version, and that is a real limitation rather than a
simplification.** `survey_definition_executor` runs the whole step graph; it only
skips steps tagged for another engine, and Egeria's `Guard` on a step link is not
honoured as a conditional. So this step cannot stop `repo_rag_ingestion` from
running. What it does is make the decision *visible and recorded* — today so a
reader can tell "refreshed nothing because nothing changed" from "refreshed
nothing because it failed", and later as the thing a guard would read.

**Two traps this is written around, both already visible in the codebase.**

*The gate cannot be one decision for the whole survey.* `IncrementalIndexer.refresh`
is the only refresh path that checks the SHA today — and on its no-change path it
*still* profiles data files if that was never run. "Unchanged" and "complete" are
different questions: a survey-wide "nothing changed, skip everything" would skip
work that was never done in the first place. So each target is judged separately,
and `never_run` is a distinct answer from `current`.

*Cheap acquisition is not cheap compute.* `SourceCache` is keyed on (repo, SHA), so
re-running an ungated step costs ~1.3s warm rather than ~23s cold. That hides the
absence of a gate rather than substituting for one — the parse, profile and embed
work repeats in full either way.

**An unreachable head SHA is `unknown`, never `current`.** Reporting "nothing
changed" because GitHub could not be asked would be a claim about the repository
derived from our own connectivity — the failure `cii_badge` refuses for badges.
