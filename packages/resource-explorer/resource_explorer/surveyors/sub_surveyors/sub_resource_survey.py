"""Sub-surveyor: repo sub-resource survey → ClassificationAnnotation.

Assessment sub-resource cataloging plan (docs/assessment-sub-resource-
cataloging.md) and the repo scope-narrowing funnel (docs/repo-scope-
narrowing-funnel.md) — this is the *survey* half, explicitly separate from
*catalog* (the local `sub_resources` registry table + selection UI) and
*Egeria publish* (EgeriaPublisher.publish_sub_resources()), both of which
consume this surveyor's finding, later, only for whatever a human selects.
This surveyor never talks to Egeria.

D1: walks `project_file_inventory` (already persisted, no new fetch) to
determine which top-level folders and which well-known files are "worthy"
of becoming their own Egeria asset later — a recommendation, not a side
effect. D9: also captures metadata tiered by cost — free/whole-repo
(mode, size, CODEOWNERS-derived ownership) vs. expensive/worthy-subset-only
(last-updated/first-added commit dates, since there is no batch git-history
API). D10/D11: size/mode distributions persisted as metric snapshots,
append-only, for growth-over-time trending.
