"""Sub-surveyor: the security topic summary — a REDUCER, not a measurement.

This step measures nothing about the repository. It reads what the other
security steps already wrote and says one thing about the topic, which is the
shape `docs/survey-composition-and-topic-summary-design.md` calls a reducer.
`foss_scorecard` was already one; this is the first declared as such.

**Three properties it exists to preserve, none of which a summary gets for free.**

*Which moment is being summarised.* Findings are read at `MAX(surveyed_at)` per
kind, independently, so this composes the latest sighting of each input and those
can be days apart. It is a **state** summary, not a summary of one run — so it
carries `oldest_input_at`, the age of the stalest thing it relied on, rather than
only the time it was computed. A confident sentence stamped today, resting on a
month-old CVE scan, is exactly the staleness `cii_badge` refuses to launder for
badge levels.

*Absence is not a finding.* An input that never ran and an input that ran and
found nothing are different facts, and averaging them into a score is how a
survey of four missing steps reports a clean bill of health. Coverage is reported
alongside the verdict, and a verdict is refused outright below a floor.

*Precedence is declared, not accidental.* Two inputs answer the security-policy
question at different strengths: `security_scan` says the file exists,
`repo_conventions` says it exists **and** contains a disclosure process. The
second subsumes the first. The stronger wins and the weaker is retained as
corroboration rather than dropped — and it is written down here rather than
falling out of the order a loop happens to iterate in, which is what
`foss_scorecard` does today.

#: NOTE the first entry. The *analysis id* is `security_scan`; the **findings
#: kind it writes** is `security_hygiene` — they diverged when SecuritySurveyor
#: was renamed SecurityHygieneSurveyor and the id was deliberately left alone
#: because it keys schedules and stored data. Using the analysis id here read as
#: "security_scan never ran" for every repo on the first run of this reducer:
#: a typo in this tuple is indistinguishable from an un-run input, which is the
#: precise failure this step exists to prevent, reproduced inside it.
#: `test_security_summary.py` pins every entry against the kinds actually
#: written, so the next divergence fails a test instead of quietly widening a
#: gap in the summary.
