"""Sub-surveyor: Git Statistics → ResourceMeasureAnnotation.

Refreshes `project_stats` — stars, forks, contributors, commit activity,
releases, security-and-analysis config, deployments — from the GitHub API, and
reports what it fetched.

Why this is its own step rather than a side effect of one reader.
`project_stats` is the most widely read table in the repo survey set: eight
sub-surveyors read it (health, maturity, language, file_structure,
license_classifier, security_features, security_hygiene, homepage). Exactly one
of them — HealthSurveyor — refreshed it, as an internal side effect, and the
other seven read whatever happened to be there. So the freshness of licence
classification, maturity, security-feature and homepage results depended on
whether repo_health happened to be in the same survey and happened to run first
— an ordering nothing declared and nothing enforced. Run any of those seven
without repo_health and they silently scored registration-time data.

That is the same shape as the two microflow steps already here:
repo_symbol_extraction (project_code_symbols, previously written only by RAG
ingestion) and repo_file_inventory (project_file_inventory, previously written
only by ingestion/refresh_profile). Each replaced an implicit prerequisite with
a declared, ordered, re-runnable step. This is the third and the most-shared of
the three.

Ordered first in STEP_REGISTRY, which is also the order "Repo Full Survey" runs
(the "*" sentinel in repo_survey_types.csv), so every reader in the same run
sees this run's numbers.

Cost: unchanged — one GitHub API pass per survey, now explicit and shared. `fast` skips StatsFetcher's
per-commit diff-stats calls — a confirmed real slowness (several hundred
sequential API calls for an active repo's 90-day history), which is why Coarse
Scout sets it.

Running a reader step in isolation (repo_health alone, say) no longer refreshes
stats implicitly; it reports against what is stored, and its `surveyed_at` shows
how old that is. That is the same trade repo_file_inventory made, and the reason
the refresh is a visible step rather than a hidden side effect.
