"""Sub-surveyor: RAG ingestion → ResourceMeasureAnnotation.

Refreshes the project's pgvector collections via `IncrementalIndexer.refresh()`
and reports what is actually indexed afterwards.

Why this is a survey step. `project_code_symbols`, `project_file_inventory` and
`project_stats` each had the same defect — a table many survey steps *read* that
no survey step *wrote*, populated only by RAG ingestion or a registration-time
side effect. Each was fixed by turning the implicit prerequisite into a declared,
ordered, re-runnable step (repo_symbol_extraction, repo_file_inventory,
repo_git_statistics). This is the fourth and largest instance: ingestion
populates the pgvector collections Chat, the query router and every RAG-backed
answer depend on, and it ran at registration, on webhook, from the scheduler and
from a bespoke on-demand route — never as part of a survey, never with a
survey's freshness signal, never with results.

Analysis is where a repo's *queryable representation* gets built. Every other
stage produces annotations about a repo; this one produces the thing
Understanding and Chat interrogate.

Wraps `IncrementalIndexer.refresh()`, not `IngestionPipeline.run()` (plan D1).
The incremental path is the right semantics for a repeatable step: a no-op when
`last_commit_sha` is unchanged, so it stays cheap in a survey that runs often.
Full ingestion stays at registration — a survey step must never be the thing
that decides to embed a repo from scratch for the first time.

No `requires_resources={"zipball_root": ...}` (plan D2), unlike
repo_file_inventory/repo_symbol_extraction. IncrementalIndexer downloads its own
zipball *conditionally*, only when there are changed files
(`ingestion/incremental.py`), so declaring the shared resource would force a
download on every run including the common no-op case: **the resource-sharing
win does not apply to a step whose common case is fetching nothing at all.**

Ordered LAST in STEP_REGISTRY (plan D3), unlike the other three microflow steps
which are ordered first because their consumers read what they write. Nothing
downstream reads pgvector — it is consumed by Chat and the query router, not by
other survey steps — and this is by far the most expensive operation in the set.
STEP_REGISTRY order is also "Full Survey (all steps)" order (the "*" sentinel in
repo_survey_types.csv), so an expensive optional step placed anywhere but last
would delay the cheap signals a survey exists to produce.

Reports live pgvector counts rather than what this run happened to do, so the
results answer the question a user actually has — "is my chat index current, and
how big is it?" — and stay correct when the step no-ops.
