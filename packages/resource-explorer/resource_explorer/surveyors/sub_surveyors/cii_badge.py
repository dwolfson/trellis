"""Sub-surveyor: the OpenSSF Best Practices badge (formerly the CII badge).

Unlike every other scorecard in this package, this one does not estimate
anything. The badge is a real, externally-held record, so the honest answer is
to go and read it: one GET against bestpractices.dev, the same shape of cheap
authoritative lookup cve_scan makes against OSV.

**Three answers, kept apart, because they are genuinely different.**

    registered      the project has a badge record — report its level
    not_registered  no record exists. A FACT about the project, not a gap in
                    our data, and the direct answer to "is it badged?"
    unreachable     we could not ask. Never rendered as "not registered".

The third is the one that needs saying. A network failure that reads as "this
project has no badge" would be a claim about someone's project derived from our
own connectivity, and it is the single most likely way this module could lie.

**A badge level is a self-assessment with a date on it, and the date is part of
the finding.** Measured 2026-08-26: odpi/egeria holds a *silver* badge whose
record was last updated 2022-12-20 — a claim made about a codebase nearly four
years ago, still displayed as current. Reporting "silver" alone would carry the
authority of the badge and none of its staleness, so the age rides in the
summary and drives its own finding once past the threshold below.

**"Met" and "?" are not the same, in their record either.** Of egeria's 196
criteria fields, 115 are Met, 66 are unanswered, 13 N/A and 1 Unmet. The
unanswered ones are reported as unanswered rather than folded into either side.
