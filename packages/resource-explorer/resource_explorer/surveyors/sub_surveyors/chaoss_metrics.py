"""Sub-surveyor: CHAOSS community-health metrics, over commit authorship.

CHAOSS (Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software) is a set of named,
defined metrics rather than a score, which suits this codebase: each one is
reported on its own terms and none are averaged together.

**The metric that justifies the whole module is the Elephant Factor** — the
smallest number of contributors who between them account for half the commits.
`project_contributor_stats` has held the per-author commit counts needed to
compute it for thirty repositories and nothing has ever read them. Measured
across the catalogue on 2026-08-26, it separates projects that every other
signal here calls the same:

    deep_causality       5 authors, 2791 commits, elephant factor 1  (98% one person)
    opea_project…        1 author,   493 commits, elephant factor 1  (100%)
    egeria_git           3 authors, 1761 commits, elephant factor 1  (64%)
    polaris             49 authors, 1488 commits, elephant factor 2
    sqlglot             79 authors, 1429 commits, elephant factor 3
    openmetadata        72 authors, 2318 commits, elephant factor 8
    kafka              113 authors,  758 commits, elephant factor 15

repository_health's community_score rates deep_causality 100/100. CommunitySupport
already improves on that by reporting the contributor COUNT, but a count still
calls deep_causality a five-person project. The distribution is what says one
person wrote 98% of it, and that is the fact someone deciding whether to depend
on it most needs.

**Why this reads project_commits and not project_contributor_stats.** The
latter looks like the natural source — it holds per-author commit counts by
period — but its "periods" are nested trailing windows (30d, 90d, 365d, all
ending today), not sequential ones. Built on it, this module double-counted
every recent commit once per window, and its turnover metric compared the 30-day
window against the 90-day window that CONTAINS it: first-time contributors came
out as zero for every repository in the catalogue, and kafka, sqlglot, milvus
and openmetadata were all labelled "shrinking" for purely arithmetic reasons.
project_commits holds the individual commits with their timestamps, so periods
can be cut disjointly and each commit counted once.

The window is roughly 90 days deep, which is what is collected — shorter than
CHAOSS intends for authorship concentration, so every finding states the span
and the commit count it was computed over rather than presenting itself as an
all-time figure.

**Organizational diversity is reported only when it can be.** 72% of the
author emails in the catalogue are `users.noreply.github.com` or `gmail.com` —
no employer is recoverable from either. Where most authorship is unattributable
the metric says so rather than reporting the diversity of the minority that
happens to use a corporate address, which would systematically overstate it.
