"""Sub-surveyor: CLA/DCO provenance — stated vs. enforced
(`docs/gap-analyses-design.md` §3).

Answers `docs/dr-egeria/resource_questions.csv:31` verbatim. Two checks,
deliberately: `cla_dco_stated` (does CONTRIBUTING content actually mention
DCO/CLA — not just "a file exists", the exact shallowness
`SecurityHygieneSurveyor` has today for its three checks) and
`cla_dco_enforced` (is there a config/workflow/branch-protection signal
that actually gates PRs on it — a stated-but-unenforced policy is worse
than either extreme, per design §3, because it creates a false sense of
coverage).

**Analysis id vs finding kind** (design §0). Proposed `analysis_catalog`
id: `contribution_provenance`. Finding **kind**:
`"contribution_provenance_findings"`.

**Task scope boundary**: not registered. Proposed `StepInfo`:

    step_key            = "repo_contribution_provenance"
    surveyor_cls         = ContributionProvenanceSurveyor
    annotation_types      = ["ClassificationAnnotation",
                             "RequestForActionAnnotation"]
    accepts_surveyed_at   = True
    requires_resources    = {"zipball_root": "local_path"}
    requires_views        = {"zipball_root": VIEW_SOURCE}
    requires_context       = {"has_file_inventory": "checks for
                              CONTRIBUTING.md and enforcement config paths
                              via the file inventory before reading their
                              content"}
    fetch_cost            = "download"
    compute_cost          = "low"   # VERIFY — reads a handful of specific
                                     # files, not a full-tree walk; design
                                     # §3's own prior, not measured here.

Proposed `ANALYSIS_KINDS` entry: id `contribution_provenance`,
`step_keys=["repo_contribution_provenance"]`, `family` not `"security"` —
design frames this as a legal/IP-provenance question; flagged for whoever
registers this, same as `telemetry_scan`.

**Measured before building, per design's "Honest limits" §**: grepped
`resource_explorer/github/stats_fetcher.py` and
`security_features.py` for `branch_protection`/`required_status_checks` —
**absent from both**. Branch-protection required-status-check data is
NOT captured anywhere in this codebase today, confirmed rather than
assumed. So the "enforcement config found via GitHub's own branch
protection" half of `cla_dco_enforced` cannot be answered at all by this
surveyor as built — it always reports `UNVERIFIED`
(`cause="branch_protection_not_fetched"`) for that specific sub-question,
never `NO_SIGNAL`, per design §3's own worked example ("we didn't check
GitHub's branch protection" and "GitHub's branch protection doesn't
require it" are different claims"). Fetching that data is new plumbing
(a new GitHub API call, or extending `stats_fetcher.py`) — out of scope
here, flagged for the registration pass per the design's own "Honest
limits" section.
