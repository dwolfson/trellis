"""Sub-surveyor: Dependencies → DataClassAnnotation.

`project_dependencies` is written by exactly one thing — `IngestionPipeline`
(`ingestion/pipeline.py`) — and by no survey step, the same trap that
`project_file_inventory` and `project_code_symbols` were in before
`repo_file_inventory` and `repo_symbol_extraction` were added. Measured
2026-08-22: **3 of 58 registered resources had any dependency row at all**, and
the repos with none ship manifests — docling a pyproject.toml, milvus a
Cargo.toml, go.mod and requirements.txt, trellis a package.json and a
pyproject.toml, egeria_git a build.gradle. All of them reported nothing, and
reported it silently.

This step therefore has an unusually good known-positive available, better than
the generic "the upstream table has rows": **a dependency manifest in the file
inventory**. If a manifest is present and no dependencies were extracted, the
zero is demonstrably wrong — that is `unverified`, not a finding. If no manifest
is present, a repo declaring no dependencies is a real and unremarkable answer,
and `no_signal` is honest.

The missing extractor itself is a separate piece of work (a `repo_dependency_
extraction` step, mirroring `repo_symbol_extraction`) — logged in
docs/Backlog.md rather than built here. This step's job is to stop the gap
being invisible.
