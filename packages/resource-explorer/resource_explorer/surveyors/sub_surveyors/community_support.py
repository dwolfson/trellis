"""Sub-surveyor: is this supported by a community, or merely popular?

Answers "is it supported by a community?" from `project_stats` alone — no
fetch, the same read-only relationship CiQualitySurveyor has with its data.

**Why this is not repository_health's community_score.** That score is

    stars/100*20 + forks/20*20 + min(contributors,50)*1.2

which is dominated by attention. Measured across the real catalog on
2026-08-26: `docling_graph` scores **100/100** on it with **four
contributors** — 683 stars and 71 forks max out the popularity terms on their
own. 22 of 59 registered repos have six contributors or fewer. A number that
says "excellent community" about a project one person could strand is the
failure this codebase keeps finding, in the one place it most affects a
decision to depend on something.

So this reports DIMENSIONS and never a single number:

    attention      how many noticed        stars, forks, watchers
    participation  how many contribute     contributor count, bus factor
    channels       where you would ask     discussions, issues, wiki
    responsiveness whether anyone answers  — not measurable from what we hold

Rolling them together is precisely what produced the misleading score, so the
headline names the WEAKEST dimension rather than averaging them. High attention
with low participation is the specific shape worth surfacing, and it gets its
own finding rather than being averaged away.

`responsiveness` is honest about being absent: issue and PR response times are
not collected, and the number of open issues says nothing about whether anyone
replies to them.
