"""Sub-surveyor: Manifest Parse -> project_dependencies + project_analysis_findings.

Three tables are written ONLY by IngestionPipeline, and by no survey step:

  * project_dependencies                     (_parse_dependencies, called ONLY
                                               from full ingestion, never from
                                               refresh_profile)
  * project_analysis_findings kind="ci_quality"      (_parse_ci_workflows,
                                               called from both)
  * project_analysis_findings kind="repo_conventions" (_parse_repo_conventions,
                                               called from both)

Measured 2026-08-22: dependencies present for 3 of 58 registered resources,
ci_quality for 4/58, repo_conventions for 5/58. The org-import/discovery path
deliberately skips ingestion (see org_importer.py), so for most resources
these three tables are simply empty, and DependencySurveyor/CiQualitySurveyor/
RepoConventionsSurveyor — all read-only at survey time — report a confident
nothing forever. Same trap project_file_inventory and project_code_symbols
were in before repo_file_inventory and repo_symbol_extraction closed it.

Same self-contained microflow shape as FileInventorySurveyor and
SymbolExtractionSurveyor: acquire the shared zipball_root resource (D6),
write, then report what was written. Costs no extra network call in any
survey that already has a zipball step — resolve_resources shares one
extraction root per SurveyOrchestrator.run().

Delegates to the three existing parsers (DependencyParser, CiWorkflowParser,
RepoConventionsParser) rather than reimplementing them — one implementation
of "how to parse a manifest/workflow/convention signal", shared with
ingestion. Calls the parsers directly (not IngestionPipeline._parse_*)
because those methods swallow their own exceptions into a console.print and
return None, which is exactly the information this step needs to tell
`recovered` apart from `unverified` apart from a genuine zero — the outcome
labelling this step exists to produce would be lost behind that log line.
The registry calls this step makes (upsert_dependencies / upsert_finding)
are the same calls the pipeline methods make, so both paths still write the
tables identically.

Each of the three sub-parses runs in its own try/except: one parser raising
must not prevent the other two from writing (per-item isolation, a hard
rule in this codebase — see dependency.py's own DependencySurveyor for the
precedent this file follows for outcome labelling).
