"""Sub-surveyor: License/copyleft risk classification → ClassificationAnnotation.

Assessment expansion plan B1 (docs/assessment-expansion-plan.md). Closes a
real gap flagged while authoring the Scouting Question/Perspective model
(docs/dr-egeria/scouting-questions.csv): the GitHub API's license field is
already fetched at Scouting-tier for free, but nothing classifies it —
"Are there any restrictions for use?" and the explicit copyleft-terms
question were both GAP-tagged there.

Deliberately a static SPDX-id -> risk-tier lookup table, not an external
tool integration (FOSSology/LicenseFinder/ClearlyDefined, named as future
candidates in the CSV) — a legitimate, immediately-buildable first cut from
data RE already has (project_stats.license_spdx_id, itself added alongside
this surveyor — see stats_fetcher.py's _license_info()).
