"""Sub-surveyor: File Size → ResourceMeasureAnnotation + RequestForAction.

Uses project_file_inventory (populated during add/refresh) to produce
precise per-file size metrics.  The FileStructureSurveyor reports a rough
`repo_size_kb` from the GitHub API; this surveyor gives exact sizing from
the actual stored inventory and flags oversized individual files.
