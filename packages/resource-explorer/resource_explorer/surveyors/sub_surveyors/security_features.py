"""Sub-surveyor: GitHub's native security/analysis feature toggles →
ClassificationAnnotation per feature.

Assessment expansion plan B2 (docs/assessment-expansion-plan.md). Reads
project_stats.security_and_analysis_json — already fetched by StatsFetcher
(stats_fetcher.py's _security_and_analysis(), populated from GitHub's
`repo.security_and_analysis` API object), zero new API calls, no zipball
needed.

Distinct from SecurityHygieneSurveyor (repo_security / "security_scan"),
which checks for *presence of artifacts* (SECURITY.md, CI config, LICENSE)
via file inventory — this reads GitHub's own *feature configuration state*
(is Dependabot/secret-scanning/etc. actually turned on), a different signal
entirely, hence its own analysis kind rather than folding into that one.
