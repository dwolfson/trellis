"""Sub-surveyor: Architecture Coupling -> ResourceMeasureAnnotation.

Phase 1 plan §4.2, step key `repo_arch_coupling`. Wraps
resource_explorer.surveyors.arch_recovery's ported imports/cochange/
coupling modules (scripts/arch-spike, findings 23-44): import-graph +
co-change coupling as a boundary PROPOSER (§4.1), not the Phase 0 scorer.

Needs real git history, which a zipball does not have — this is the reason
`git_clone_root` exists at all (design §5.7 gap 2,
repo_survey_definition_adapter.py's `_acquire_git_clone_root`), so
`requires_resources = {"git_clone_root": "local_path"}`, deliberately
different from repo_arch_detect's zipball_root. That is also why this is a
second StepInfo rather than folded into repo_arch_detect: the two steps
need different resources, even though grouping them into one Survey
Definition still shares one checkout per resource kind via `_run_batch`.

Co-change is computed and attached as a *supporting* metric
(`cochange_cohesion`) alongside every proposed component, and — as of
2026-08-22 (design §4.1d, finding 63) — is also passed into
`coupling.propose()` itself, where it can rescue a subtree from
`merge-candidate` when import cohesion had literally nothing to say about
it (e.g. `web/static` — no Python imports touch pure JS/HTML/CSS). It still
never feeds the shape classification's fan-in/fan-out dispersion rule
(finding 34) directly — only import edges are directional enough for
that — so a co-change rescue always comes out `connective-seam`, never
`connective-library`/`connective-orchestrator`, and at a capped confidence.
See `coupling.py`'s module docstring for the full reasoning.

        #                                    needs files on disk.

        #                                    git history and no file contents.
        #

        # empty tree, produced zero edges, and coupling proposed zero
        # components on every real repo. The first live run against
        # egeria-python returned 9 components, all from manifests and code
        # markers, and none from coupling.
        #
        # `--no-checkout` is correct for the history view — without it a
        # treeless clone fetches every blob in HEAD, defeating the filter. It
