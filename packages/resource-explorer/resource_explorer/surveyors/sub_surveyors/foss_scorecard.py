"""Sub-surveyor: an OpenSSF-Scorecard-shaped assessment, over data already held.

Answers "how does it measure up on the FOSS scorecard?" without collecting
anything new. Every check below reads `project_stats`, the file inventory, or
findings another analysis already wrote — the same read-only-at-survey-time
relationship CiQualitySurveyor has with its own findings.

The four supply-chain checks (2026-08-26) work the same way: SupplyChainParser
parses .github/workflows at ingestion time, where the zipball is already on
disk, and this reads what it wrote. Until it has run they report `unknown`
with what would make them evaluable — never `fail`, because "we have not
parsed the workflows" and "the workflows are unsafe" are opposite claims and
only one of them is an accusation.

**The one place this deliberately departs from OpenSSF Scorecard.** Scorecard
awards a low score to a check it could not evaluate, so "this project has no
branch protection" and "we could not see whether it has branch protection"
both land as a bad number, and the aggregate silently mixes them. That is the
failure this codebase keeps removing, so here an unevaluable check reports
`not_established` and is EXCLUDED from the score, and the coverage is reported
alongside it: a 9.1 scored over 6 of 13 checks is a different claim from a 9.1
scored over 13, and the reader gets to see which they have.

Consequently the score is not comparable with a published OpenSSF score. It is
not trying to be — it is trying to be true about what was measured.

Checks are declared in CHECKS, one entry each, so adding one is a function and
a row rather than an edit in several places.
