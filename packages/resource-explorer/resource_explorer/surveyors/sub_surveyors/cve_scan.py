"""Sub-surveyor: dependency advisories from OSV.dev, over dependencies already parsed.

Answers "are there CVEs?" without collecting anything new about the repo — the
input is `project_dependencies`, written by the manifest parser at ingestion
time. The only new thing is one batched call to a public advisory database.

**Coverage is reported as prominently as the count, and the reason is not
pedantry.** A clean result here means "none of the dependencies we could check
had an advisory", which is a much weaker claim than "this repo has no
vulnerable dependencies", and three things routinely separate them:

* **Unparsed ecosystems.** Measured 2026-08-26 across the whole catalog: 5959
  dependencies in javascript, python, java and go — and zero from Cargo, even
  though Rust repos are registered. A Rust project scanned here would come back
  clean having had nothing scanned at all. That is the single most dangerous
  answer this analysis could give.
* **Missing versions.** OSV matches on version; 5% of recorded dependencies
  have none, and those cannot be queried.
* **Transitive dependencies.** The manifest parser records what a manifest
  declares. Advisories in the tree below that are invisible here.

So a run reports `checked`, `unqueryable` and `ecosystems_seen` alongside the
findings, and NEVER emits a clean bill of health without them. A network
failure produces no finding at all rather than a clean one — "we could not ask"
and "we asked and nothing came back" are opposite answers.
