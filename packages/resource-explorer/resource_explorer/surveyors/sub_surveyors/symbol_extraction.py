"""Sub-surveyor: Symbol Extraction → ResourceMeasureAnnotation.

D5 (docs/unified-survey-execution-model-plan.md) — the one real, previously-
named bug this microflow structurally eliminates: project_code_symbols was
populated only by RAG ingestion's inline _ingest_code() step (full add, or
incremental refresh of a project that already has code collections
ingested) — never by anything in SurveyOrchestrator's own step list. A repo
registered without RAG ingestion (e.g. the org-import/discovery path, which
deliberately skips ingestion — see org_importer.py) or one whose language
was never selected as a collection at ingest time could never get symbols
any other way, leaving ApiStructureSurveyor (repo_api_structure) and any
future consumer permanently empty with no self-healing path.

A self-contained microflow per D5's model: acquire the shared zipball_root
resource (D6), extract + upsert project_code_symbols (write), then report
what it just wrote (read) — same "every read needs a save" shape as every
other D5 microflow, just with extraction itself as the write instead of a
pre-existing pipeline step. Deliberately kept as its own StepInfo rather
than folded into ApiStructureSurveyor's reporting (the D5 doc's flagged,
unresolved choice) — see repo_survey_definition_adapter.py's ANALYSIS_KINDS
"api_structure" entry, which bundles this step ahead of repo_api_structure
so requesting API-structure analysis is now self-refreshing by construction,
while this step also stays independently runnable/schedulable on its own.
