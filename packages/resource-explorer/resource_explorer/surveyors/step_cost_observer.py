"""What a step actually cost, against what it declared.

Three cost mis-declarations turned up in one week, and no test could have
caught any of them because every one was a *declaration* that disagreed with
*behaviour*:

  * `repo_classification` declared `fetch_cost="none"` and called the GitHub
    API — ~10 minutes per repo against a tier whose defining property is zero
    fetch (CLAUDE.md rule 17). It was found by noticing a corpus run had done
    3 repos in 10 minutes, not by any check.
  * `repo_manifest_parse` declared `compute_cost="medium"` and measures like
    `repo_file_inventory`, which is `low` — so `max_compute_cost="low"` runs
    excluded it from the very tier it was added to serve.
  * A timing was reported for `resolve_doc_locations()` when the thing that
    runs is `build_report()` — out by 8x, in the flattering direction.

The common cause is that a cost tier is a guess made when a step is authored
and nothing measures it afterwards. `tests/test_analysis_catalog_reader.py`'s
zero-fetch guard checks `requires_resources`, not `fetch_cost`, and a step can
satisfy it while opening sockets — a guard that can be satisfied by declaring
one thing and doing another is not a guard.

**This reports; it never corrects.** Auto-updating a declaration from an
observation would have silently absorbed the `repo_classification` bug: a step
that suddenly starts fetching is sometimes a regression worth seeing, not a
label worth rewriting. Observed and declared are recorded side by side and the
disagreement is surfaced; deciding which is wrong is a person's job, because
sometimes it is the code.

**A first observation is loud on purpose.** For a step nobody has ever
measured, "no disagreement recorded" and "never checked" are the same silence —
the shape of most of what went wrong this week.

Socket counting is deliberately crude: `socket.socket.connect` is wrapped for
the duration of a step. Under concurrent surveys in one process the count can
attribute another thread's connection to this step, so a NON-ZERO count on a
step declared zero-fetch is a prompt to look, not a proof. A zero count is the
trustworthy direction, and that asymmetry is stated rather than hidden.

**And there is a second asymmetry, found while verifying §17.2 live against a
real database (2026-09-23): the zero is NOT trustworthy for a step that
connects through libpq.** `psycopg2` opens its socket inside the C client, so
`socket.socket.connect` is never called and `connects` comes back 0 for a
`postgres_schema_and_stats` run that demonstrably opened a connection. The
`fetch_cost='none'` disagreement check therefore cannot fire for ANY database
step, which is worth knowing before reading a clean board as evidence. The
database family's real fetch signal is `api_calls`/`bytes_fetched` over HTTP
(Egeria) plus, when it is built, §17.2's `source_queries` — the optional,
sampled axis this phase deliberately does not build.

**Seconds are one axis of a vector (2026-09-23, design §17.2).** Wall time is
what the user waits and is not what the funnel's argument is about: a step
that waits on the network is cheap in CPU and slow in wall time, and for
repositories the scarce resource is the GitHub rate budget rather than either.
`observe()` now also captures CPU time, bytes fetched, API and Egeria calls,
cache hits, LLM tokens and the step's own yield, and `record()` writes the
whole vector as one `step_runs` row instead of two per-step metrics scattered
across project rows. The old `project_analysis_metrics` write is KEPT — the
`funnel-cost-measured.md` measurement and every existing reader query it, and
a migration that moved the numbers on the same day the vector arrived would
have made a gap in the history look like a change in the costs.
