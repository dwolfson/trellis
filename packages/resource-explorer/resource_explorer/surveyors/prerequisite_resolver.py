"""A step's prerequisites run themselves, within the budget the user chose.

Design §17.1. **Decision (project owner, 2026-09-23):** prerequisite surveys or
steps are executed automatically as needed, telling the user.

What happened before: `step_preconditions` checked whether the stored data a
step reads exists, and a step whose input was missing was **skipped with a
named reason**. Honest, and the wrong outcome for someone who asked the
question — they got "skipped: no parsed dependencies" when the answer was one
cheap step away.

This module turns that check into a plan. Three things make it safe, and they
are the design:

**1. The budget is the consent.** A prerequisite whose declared costs sit
inside the tier the caller is already operating at runs unasked; one that
crosses into a more expensive tier, needs a download or clone, needs
credentials the executor cannot resolve (rule B), or is answered by a human
becomes a **proposal** the user confirms. A user who picked Scouting never
triggers an Analysis-tier fetch by accident, and a user who picked Analysis is
not nagged about a 200 ms catalog read.

**How "the tier the caller is operating at" is read**, since the design names
the principle and not the mechanism. Two sources, in order:

  a. an explicit ceiling the run already carries — `SurveyOrchestrator.run`'s
     `max_fetch_cost`/`max_compute_cost`, the existing "compose a survey by
     budget" surface. When a caller has said what it will pay, that IS the
     budget and there is nothing to infer.
  b. otherwise, **the demanding step's own declared `fetch_cost`/
     `compute_cost`**. The user asked for that step; its tier is the tier they
     chose. This is the reading that makes §17.1's two examples come out
     right: `postgres_column_profile` (api_heavy/medium) absorbs
     `postgres_schema_and_stats` (api/low) silently, and `db_derived`
     (none/low — the zero-fetch step) cannot silently open a connection to
     fill its own input.

Deliberately NOT read from the analysis catalog's intent/stage. A step can sit
in several survey definitions at different stages; its declared cost is a
property of the step, which is what a ceiling has always been compared against
(`SurveyOrchestrator.run`'s own D5 filter uses exactly these two fields).

**2. A producer map, because preconditions name data, not steps.** See
`step_produces`. The walk is precondition → producing step → *its* own
preconditions, recursively, with:

  * a **cycle guard** — `PrerequisiteCycleError`, raised, never a silent
    truncation. A step that transitively requires itself is a declaration bug
    and the only useful response is to say so;
  * **stop rule 1** — a producer that already ran *on this snapshot* and found
    nothing is not re-run. Its `nothing_found` is the answer. Snapshot-scoped,
    not a freshness window: the question is "has this run already established
    this", and a TTL would answer a different one (and would re-run a step
    every time the clock moved, which is the loop this rule exists to break);
  * **stop rule 2** — if anything anywhere in the chain needs consent, the
    WHOLE chain collapses into one proposal naming every step and the summed
    cost. Never a partial auto-run followed by a prompt: that would spend the
    user's time and then ask permission for the rest, which is the worst
    ordering available.

**A second axis, in the same gate (2026-09-24).** `REPLY-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-
CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` §7.1, which the project owner approved building:
"Build it as one axis beside cost tier in the same gate, not as a separate
flow: a step declares `fetch_cost`, `compute_cost` and `requires_capability`,
and the launcher shows one combined reason."

So `requires_capability` is checked HERE, by the same `resolve()`, producing
the same `Proposal` with an extra `ConsentReason(kind="capability")` — not a
second resolver and not a second prompt. When both axes fire, the two reasons
land in ONE proposal and `Proposal.sentence()` joins them into one sentence;
a reader is never handed two gates to reconcile.

Two things about the capability axis are genuinely different from cost, and
both are deliberate:

  * it applies to the **demanding step itself**, not only to producers. The
    budget reading above says a step the user asked for by name is inside its
    own budget by definition — true of cost, false of capability. Asking for
    a step does not widen a grant;
  * the measurement comes from a **probe that already ran**
    (`credential_capability.stored_probe`), never from a fresh connection.
    "Never probed" is a third answer and does not block — see that module.

§7.1 names three choices at the gate: run partially and say so; pick another
visible connection; raise the RFA. The first is `Proposal.run_partially`, the
third is `credential_capability.capability_rfa`. **The second is deliberately
not built here** — it needs the multi-connection model of §1/§2, which is
separately gated on the project owner's ruling (`docs/Backlog.md`) and has no
registry table, no enumeration call and no UI yet. Offering a choice that
cannot be taken would be worse than offering two that can.

**3. An auto-run is a result, not an omission.** The caller writes the
annotation, the activity-log entry and the `step_runs` attribution — see
`auto_run_annotation()` and `Resolution.demanded_by`. This module decides; it
does not execute, so it can be tested without a survey and serialised for a
remote executor (rule E: `Resolution.as_plan()`).

        **The judgement call that makes this axis safe to add to an existing
        gate, and the one place the two axes deliberately behave
        differently.**

        A cost-tier proposal asks permission to spend something the user has
        not agreed to spend — a download, a clone, an hour of CPU. Declining
        costs them nothing; proceeding unasked is the harm, so the safe
        default is to stop.

        A capability proposal spends nothing. It says the answer will be
        bounded by what the credential can reach. Here the safe default is
        the opposite: declining costs the user their answer entirely, and
        stopping would mean a database whose credential lacks `pg_monitor`
        gets NO survey at all — strictly worse than today's under-report,
        and worse still on every path with nobody there to ask (the
        scheduler, the CLI, a Survey Definition run), which would silently
        produce nothing where they used to produce something.

        So a capability-only proposal is ADVISORY: `Resolution.may_run` stays
        true, the step runs, and the run says so — `MEASURED_WITHIN_
        CREDENTIAL_SCOPE` on the envelope (#253) and the proposal itself
        attached to the step's report entry. That is §7.1's own first choice,
        "run partially and say so", taken as the default rather than offered
        only to someone watching.

        The launcher still asks, because it asks FIRST: `/next` calls
        `/api/prerequisites/plan` before dispatching and stops on
        `status == "proposal"` whatever `may_run` says. So an interactive
        user is shown the combined reason and chooses; an unattended run

    `resolved_resources` names the D6 shared resources this run has ALREADY
    acquired, so a producer needing a zipball the run already downloaded is
    not proposed as "needs a download". Empty/None is the conservative
    reading and the one every caller outside `SurveyOrchestrator.run` uses.

    `already_ran` names producers this run has run itself (the resolver's
    caller records them), so a second demanding step does not re-run a
    producer the first one just triggered.

    `capability_probe` is the stored `credential_capability` result for this

    read here so this function stays pure and testable without a registry —
    the same reason it takes `resolved_resources` instead of inspecting a
    run. `None` means "not supplied", and the resolver fetches it itself, but
    ONLY when some step actually declares a `requires_capability`: a repo or
    filesystem resolve makes no registry call for an axis none of its steps
    use.

    `capability_consented` is §7.1's first choice already taken: the user was
    shown the shortfall and chose to run partially anyway. It suppresses the
    capability reasons ONLY — the cost axis is untouched, because the two
    consents are about different things and one is not evidence of the other.
    It is the exact analogue of `/api/prerequisites/run` naming the steps the
    user was shown: without it, an accepted "run it anyway" would re-resolve,
    re-raise the same shortfall and skip the very step the user just approved,
    which is the one outcome the accept path exists to prevent.
