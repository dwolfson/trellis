"""Pure JSON/XML value-schema inference — no Postgres, no pyegeria, no
registry.

Implements the "given a bag of sampled JSON or XML values, what is the
schema" half of `docs/multi-resource-questions-design.md` §5.4's
`nested_column_profile` question (Phase 1 slice 11, `postgres_nested_columns`
— gated on slice 10, `postgres_column_profile`, which this step shares its
sampling infrastructure with).

Deliberately factored out with **zero database coupling** — no psycopg2, no
pyegeria, no `resource_explorer.registry` import — the same way slice 10 split
`column_matching.py` out of `column_profile_step.py`. §5.4's own row names the
reason: this module "produces a `SchemaAnalysisAnnotation` with an inferred
nested schema, **reused by §6's `nested_schema_profile`**" — the filesystem
path (Phase 2, not part of this slice) needs the identical "given these
parsed JSON documents / XML trees, what's the schema" logic against files on
disk, with no database anywhere in the loop. Anything Postgres-specific
(sampling SQL, `TABLESAMPLE`, budget accounting) belongs in
`surveyors/database/nested_columns_step.py`, which calls into this module the
same way `column_profile_step.py` calls into `column_matching.py`.

Two independent shapes, because JSON and XML do not profile the same way:

- `infer_json_schema()` — walks a bag of already-PARSED JSON values (Python
  `dict` / `list` / `str` / `int` / `float` / `bool` / `None`) and returns
  per-path key presence frequency, the JSON types observed at each path and
  whether they are consistent, and how deep the structure goes.
- `infer_xml_schema()` — walks a bag of `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element` trees
  and returns root-element frequency plus element/attribute NAME frequency —
  the "xpath key sampling" §5.4 asks for, done with the stdlib parser rather
  than a Postgres `xpath()` round trip specifically so the same function can
  profile an XML *file* in §6 with no database involved at all. See
  `docs/design-notes/POSTGRES-NESTED-COLUMNS-IMPLEMENTED.md` for why this is
  a documented deviation from the design doc's literal
  `jsonb_object_keys`/`jsonb_typeof`/`xpath()` SQL-function wording rather
  than an oversight.

**Absence discipline, restated for this shape.** A "bag of values" can fail
to produce a schema for reasons that must not collapse into one:

- nothing was sampled at all (capability absent, `catalog_stats_only`, budget
  exhausted, or the query failed) — this module is never even called, and the
  caller must record `STATE_NOT_SUPPORTED`/`STATE_NOT_COLLECTED` itself (see
  `nested_columns_step.py`);
- the sample ran and returned zero non-NULL values — `classify_json_sample`/
  `classify_xml_sample` return `LABEL_EMPTY`, the caller's `STATE_EMPTY`;
- **every sampled value was a JSON scalar, not an object or array** — a real,
  different finding from "not established": the column is JSONB-typed but
  holds no nested structure to profile, which is worth surfacing as its own
  label (`LABEL_SCALAR_ONLY`) rather than an empty schema;
- some values were scalars and some were structured — `LABEL_MIXED`, also a
  real finding (inconsistent use of the column across rows);
- every value was structured (object, or array of objects) — `LABEL_STRUCTURED`,
  the ordinary case, carrying the inferred schema;
- for XML specifically, a sampled value that does not parse as well-formed
  XML at all — `LABEL_UNPARSEABLE` — is itself worth reporting rather than
  being silently skipped, since a column typed `xml` holding non-XML content
  is a data-quality finding of its own.

None of these is `MATCH_*` from `column_matching.py`: there is no known
element to compare against here, only a value shape to describe, so that
module's verdict vocabulary genuinely does not fit (this is a profiling
question, not a matching one). What IS reused, in spirit, is slice 7's
`STATE_MEASURED`/`STATE_EMPTY`/`STATE_NOT_COLLECTED`/`STATE_NOT_SUPPORTED`
"did we get a sample" layer (`resource_explorer.registry`) — this module
stays free of that import so it has no database-registry coupling, and the
caller in `nested_columns_step.py` maps `LABEL_EMPTY` to `STATE_EMPTY` and so
on. `LABEL_SCALAR_ONLY`/`LABEL_MIXED`/`LABEL_STRUCTURED`/`LABEL_UNPARSEABLE`
sit *inside* `STATE_MEASURED` — they are findings, not not-established states.

    XML has no scalar/object distinction the way JSON does — a value is
    either well-formed XML or it is not — so `LABEL_SCALAR_ONLY` is not
    reachable from this function; `LABEL_UNPARSEABLE` is XML's equivalent
    finding ("the column is typed `xml` and nothing sampled from it actually
    was"), kept as a separate label rather than reusing `LABEL_SCALAR_ONLY`
    so the two shapes' findings are not conflated in a downstream reader that
    only checks the label string.
