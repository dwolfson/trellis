"""What the connected credential can actually see and do — read back, not re-probed.

The second axis of the launcher gate, beside cost tier. `REPLY-DATABASE-
CREDENTIAL-CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` §7.1, which is the approved design:

    Build it as one axis beside cost tier in the same gate, not as a separate
    flow: a step declares `fetch_cost`, `compute_cost` and
    `requires_capability`, and the launcher shows one combined reason.

This module is the "read the probe" half. It runs nothing and opens no
connection: the `credential_capability` step (built in `#253`, wired in
`#257`) is the only thing that talks to Postgres, and everything here reads
back what that step already stored. Two reasons that split matters:

  * the gate is consulted *before* a step runs, on a resolver path that is
    supposed to be pure (`prerequisite_resolver` "decides; it does not
    execute"). A gate that opened a connection to decide whether to open a
    connection would be the cost it exists to avoid;
  * the probe's own numbers are what the banner and the envelope state
    already show the user (`routes/databases.py::_to_summary`,
    `result_status.MEASURED_WITHIN_CREDENTIAL_SCOPE`). A gate deriving its
    own second opinion would let the launcher and the banner disagree about
    the same credential, which is worse than either being wrong alone.

**"Never probed" is a third answer, and it does not block.** `assess` returns
`known=False` when no probe result has ever been stored for this resource,
and the resolver raises no consent reason for it. That direction is chosen
deliberately and is the same one `step_preconditions._needs_rows` and
`prerequisite_resolver._found_nothing_on_this_snapshot` already take: on OUR
failure to establish something, run the step. Gating on an unmeasured probe
would turn "we have not looked" into "you may not ask", for every database
registered before the probe existed — which is the absence-as-answer failure
in a new place, pointing the other way.

**There is no ordering.** A four-value vocabulary invites a ladder and the
ladder would be wrong: `stats` needs `pg_monitor` membership, `read` needs
`SELECT` grants, and neither implies the other — a monitoring role with no
table grants satisfies `stats` and fails `read`; the `egeria_user` of the
incident that started all this is the reverse on three tables. So each value
is its own predicate over the probe's own fields, and `assess` evaluates
exactly one of them.

**Correction (live-verified by the coordinating session, 2026-09-24/25):**
`stats` does NOT mean "needs `pg_monitor` to see per-table activity/row-count
counters" — that premise, baked into this module (and into
`DATABASE-STEP-CAPABILITY-AUDIT.md`) since `#262`, is wrong. `pg_stat_user_
tables`, `pg_stat_user_indexes` (and, checked while fixing this,
`pg_stat_database`/`pg_stat_bgwriter`/`pg_stat_archiver`/`pg_stat_wal`) are
plain views over catalog state with no ACL predicate at all — confirmed
live against `coco_pharma` as `egeria_user` (not a `pg_monitor` member):
`pg_stat_user_tables` returned all 58 rows, matching an independent
`pg_class`/`pg_namespace` count exactly, with real non-null `n_tup_ins`/
`last_vacuum` values even for schemas `egeria_user` has no `USAGE` grant on.
Those views are `catalog`-tier, the same as `pg_namespace`/`pg_class`
themselves — see `DATABASE-STEP-CAPABILITY-AUDIT.md`'s "Correction" section
for the full per-view table.

What `pg_monitor`/`pg_read_all_stats` actually gate, confirmed the same way
(a second session's query masked to `<insufficient privilege>` in
`pg_stat_activity` for a non-`pg_monitor` role): visibility into OTHER
sessions/connections — `pg_stat_activity`'s query text and state for rows
that are not your own, and (per Postgres's own view definitions, same
mechanism, not independently reproducible in this environment because no
standby was attached) `pg_stat_replication`. `stats` keeps that meaning; the
probe (`stats_role`, driven by `pg_has_role(current_user, 'pg_monitor',
'MEMBER')`) is still the right check for it, and `db_resilience` still
correctly declares `stats` because it reads `pg_stat_replication`. What
changed is which steps' OUTPUT actually depends on that boundary —
`postgres_schema_and_stats`'s row-count/activity display does not, and is
now declared `read` instead (see `survey_definition_adapter.py`).
