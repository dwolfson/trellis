"""Append-only write path for the Question catalog CSV
(docs/dr-egeria/resource_questions.csv) — the ONLY new backend surface
SPEC-ADMIN-THE-FOUR-GAPS.md §4 asked for. Backs Admin > Question Catalog's
"add question" / "retire" actions.

**Decision (project owner, 2026-09-20):** the catalog is append-only. You
may ADD a new question and RETIRE an existing one. You may never reword an
existing question's text — editing a question changes the meaning of
answers already recorded against it (a survey result that answered "does it
have a published spec?" did not answer a reworded question), and this
module is deliberately built so an edit is impossible to express, not just
undiscoverable in the UI: there is no `update_question()` function here, and
`add_question()` refuses (rather than upserts) when the question text
already exists in the CSV, retired or not.

**Why the CSV, not a new table.** docs/dr-egeria/resource_questions.csv is
the actual source of truth for two independently generated outputs — this
package's own configdata/question_catalog.yaml (via
scripts/csv_to_question_catalog_yaml.py) AND the Dr.Egeria markdown batch
that creates real Egeria Question elements (scripts/csv_to_dr_egeria_questions.py)
— and both generators are guarded by byte-identical regeneration tests
(tests/test_question_catalog_generator_guard.py). Standing up a database
table as a second, competing source of truth would either fork the CSV's
authority or require this module to also own regenerating the Dr.Egeria
markdown and re-running it against a live platform, which is out of scope
for an Admin CRUD pane. Writing the CSV and regenerating the YAML that
already ships from it keeps exactly one source of truth and reuses the
existing generator rather than re-deriving its parsing rules.

**Concurrency.** The CSV has no row-level locking of its own, and this is a
real gap the spec asked to be honest about rather than paper over: a
FileLock (already a transitive dependency — see observability/logging_setup.py)
serializes read-modify-write across processes/threads, and both the CSV and
the regenerated YAML are written via a temp-file-then-`os.replace()` swap so
a reader (question_catalog_reader.py, or a `cat`) never observes a
half-written file. This is the minimal viable fix for a low-traffic admin
form, not a migration to a database-backed catalog — a CSV genuinely cannot
give the transactional guarantees a shared Postgres table would under real
concurrent write load, and if this pane ever sees that kind of traffic, that
migration is the right next step, not a bigger lock.
