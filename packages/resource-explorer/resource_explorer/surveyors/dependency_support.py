"""Which technologies does a repository's dependency list indicate — and does
Egeria already know about them?

Answers the question catalog's *"Do we already support these dependencies?"*
as a **starting point for people**, not as an answer. Decision (project owner,
2026-09-11): Egeria may hold a starting point that "would still need
corroboration and augmentation by people"; and (2026-09-12) "A now, shaped to
seed B" — the curated mapping lives in RE (`configdata/dependency_support.yaml`)
today, with each entry linked to the Egeria technology type it will later be
promoted into.

**Why a curated mapping and not string matching** — measured 2026-09-12 before
building: against 2,894 distinct dependency names, Egeria's 213 technology
types matched TWO by exact name, and token overlap matched 373 that were nearly
all wrong (`apache_atlas` → Apache Airflow via "apache"). `psycopg2` ↔
PostgreSQL is knowledge, not similarity; the YAML is that knowledge. See the
file's own header.

**Three things a reader must be able to tell apart**, because collapsing them
is this codebase's dominant bug class:

* a dependency that MATCHED a curated technology — "this repo indicates X";
* a dependency that matched NOTHING — "no curated technology corresponds to
  this name", which is almost always "nobody has classified it yet" and is
  never "unsupported";
* a technology whose Egeria type could NOT BE CHECKED — Egeria unreachable —
  which is not the same as the type being absent.

The matcher here is pure and needs no Egeria; the Egeria check is a separate
function so the two failure modes cannot be confused for one another.
