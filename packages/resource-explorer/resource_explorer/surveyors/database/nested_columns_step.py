"""The `postgres_nested_columns` step (design §5.4/§5.7, Phase 1 slice 11).

Design §5.4's row for this question:

> **What is inside the JSON/JSONB/XML columns — keys, nesting, types,
> consistency across rows?** `nested_column_profile` (new; JSONB:
> `jsonb_object_keys`, `jsonb_typeof` over a sample, key frequency, depth;
> XML: root element and xpath key sampling; produces a `SchemaAnalysisAnnotation`
> with an inferred nested schema, reused by §6's `nested_schema_profile`)

§5.7's row for the step itself:

> `postgres_nested_columns` (new) | sampled JSON/XML values | api_heavy /
> medium | SchemaAnalysis (nested)

**Gated on slice 10 ("shares the inference core", per the coordinator
brief).** This module is the Postgres-specific half — identifying JSONB/JSON/
XML columns, sampling their raw values with slice 10's *exact* sampling
machinery, and building the annotations. The actual "given these sampled
values, what's the schema" logic is `nested_schema_inference.py`, imported
and never duplicated — the same split `column_profile_step.py` /
`column_matching.py` established for slice 10.

**What is deliberately reused, not reimplemented, from slice 10:**

- `sampling.py`'s `resolve_sampling_config` / `SamplingConfig` /
  `SampleProvenance` — the identical `max_rows`/`max_bytes`/`max_values`/
  strategy/seed/time-budget configuration surface, resolved with
  `purpose="matching"` (the same default slice 10 uses for value-based
  questions — a nested-schema claim is exactly that shape, not a `pg_stats`
  measure).
- `column_profile_step.py`'s `sample_column_values` and `SamplingBudget` —
  the exact SQL-execution and byte/time-budget accounting slice 10 built,
  including its `values is None` vs `values == []` distinction. No second
  sampling implementation exists in this module.
- `column_matching.py`'s `type_family` — the same column-type-to-family
  classifier slice 10 uses for its own `UNMATCHABLE_TYPE_FAMILIES` gate,
  reused here to identify which columns are `"json"` (covers `json` and
  `jsonb`) or `"xml"` in the first place.

**Absence discipline** (design brief's own wording): a column with no
JSONB/XML values sampled renders as `not_established` — never as "no nested
structure" — via `STATE_NOT_SUPPORTED`/`STATE_NOT_COLLECTED`
(`resource_explorer.registry`, slice 7's vocabulary, reused rather than a
fourth parallel one). A column where every sampled value is a JSON scalar (or,
for XML, unparseable) is `STATE_MEASURED` with a `scalar_only`/`unparseable`
label — a real, different finding, not an absence.
