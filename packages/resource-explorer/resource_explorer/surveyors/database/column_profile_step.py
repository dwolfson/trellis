"""The `postgres_column_profile` step (design §5.7, Phase 1 slice 10).

Design §5.7's row for this step:

| `postgres_column_profile` (new; sampling fallback + value-based matching) |
| sampled rows, bounded by rows and bytes per column | api_heavy / medium |
| ResourceMeasure per column, DataClass, ValidValues advice, Semantic, RFAs
  proposing classes/sets |

What is here: the sampling *execution* (the configuration surface is
`sampling.py`, the matching logic is `column_matching.py`, the Egeria reads
and DRAFT proposals are `egeria_reference_catalog.py`), plus the annotation
building for `data_class_match` and `reference_data_match`.

Deliberately a module of its own rather than four more methods on
`DatabaseSurveyor`: slices 7 and 8 own that file, this slice consumes their
output, and `survey()` reaches this step through a single delegating branch.

**Absence discipline, the shape that matters most here.** Every column gets a
row and an annotation, including the ones nothing could be said about. Four
distinct "nothing" states reach the output, and none of them renders as "no
match found":

- the engine declares no `value_sampling` capability → `STATE_NOT_SUPPORTED`;
- the configured strategy is `catalog_stats_only`, so no value was read →
  `MATCH_NOT_SAMPLED`;
- the byte or time budget ran out before this column → `MATCH_NOT_SAMPLED`,
  with the budget named as the reason;
- the platform held nothing to compare against → `MATCH_NO_CANDIDATES`.

A `data_class_match` that reports "no PII found" for a column it never read
would be the most expensive version of the defect `find-absence-as-answer`
describes, so the states above are separate all the way to the annotation's
`label`.
