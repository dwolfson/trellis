"""Grouping stored database rows by the engine's declared containment level.

REPLY-SCHEMA-AS-SUB-RESOURCE.md shape 1 (§1), with §5's per-engine correction:
a database's structural analyses aggregate at the wrong grain when they read
every visible schema as one flat bag of tables. *"Edge count 0, component count
3"* is correct for three single-table schemas and meaningless as a statement
about the database.

This module is the seam. It holds no domain logic of its own — the checks stay
in `db_derived.py`, the declaration stays in `connection.py` — only:

1. which containers exist in a set of stored rows, with the engine's system
   containers excluded (`containers_in_rows`);
2. the `WHERE`-clause equivalent for already-loaded rows (`rows_in_container`);
3. the rollup envelope every per-container payload carries, so a rollup is
   **labelled as a rollup** and never renders as an average (`rollup_envelope`,
   `undeclared_envelope`);
4. the per-schema reading of the credential-capability probe (§2), shared by
   the analysis readers and by the launcher's capability-shortfall message.

**Nothing here says "schema".** The level's name comes from the engine's
`ContainmentLevel` (`"schema"` for Postgres, `"catalog"` for DuckDB, `"owner"`
for Oracle). The *column* the rows carry is `schema_name` on every structured
database table — that is RE's own storage vocabulary, fixed by
`registry.py`'s DDL, and it is deliberately not re-exported as the level's
name.
