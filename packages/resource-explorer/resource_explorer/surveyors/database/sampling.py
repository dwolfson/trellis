"""Sampling strategy as configuration, and the provenance every sampled
answer has to carry.

Implements `docs/multi-resource-questions-design.md` §5.8 — Phase 1 slice 10.

§5.8 is a *configuration surface*, not one knob: six strategies, three
bounds, a seed and a time budget, resolvable at four scopes (global → resource
type → resource → run). And two rules that follow from it, both of which this
module exists to make hard to get wrong:

1. **The envelope carries the strategy.** An answer reads "from a random
   sample of 10,000 of 4.2M rows (seed 7, 2026-09-21)" so a consumer can tell
   a sampled null-fraction from a `pg_stats` one from a full scan.
   `SampleProvenance.describe()` is the one place that sentence is built.
2. **Matching thresholds are stated against the sample** — "conforms to Data
   Class X with 0.98 of sampled values", never an unqualified "conforms". See
   `column_matching.py`, which refuses to emit a conformance claim without a
   `SampleProvenance` to qualify it.

No pyegeria and no psycopg2 import here: this module builds SQL *text* and
describes samples. `database_surveyor.py` executes it. That split is what
lets the SQL shape be tested without a live Postgres (there is none in the
build environment — see `POSTGRES-COLUMN-PROFILE-IMPLEMENTED.md`).

# ── The six strategies (§5.8's `strategy` row) ────────────────────────────────
#
# String constants rather than an Enum because these values are configuration:
# they arrive from a settings dict / a registry row / a step parameter, and they
# are written back out into `database_column_profiles.sample_strategy` and into
# an annotation's properties. An Enum would mean converting at four boundaries.

#: Read nothing. Profile from the database's own `pg_stats` only (slice 7's
#: path). The default for *measures* — and the reason `column_matching.py`
#: needs a "not sampled at all" state distinct from "no match found": under
#: this strategy no value was ever read, so nothing can be said about
#: value-pattern conformance. That is `not_established`, not "no match".
CATALOG_STATS_ONLY = "catalog_stats_only"

#: `LIMIT n` with no ordering — fast and biased toward whatever the heap
#: returns first (in practice the oldest rows). Never a default; an explicit
#: choice for "I only need to see the shape of a value".
HEAD = "head"

#: `TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM`/`BERNOULLI` with `REPEATABLE (seed)`. The default for
#: *value matching*. §5.8 names `TABLESAMPLE` specifically, in preference to
#: `ORDER BY random() LIMIT n` — the latter sorts the whole table to return a
#: handful of rows, which is exactly the cost this tier must not pay.
RANDOM = "random"

#: Every n-th row, by `row_number()`. Deterministic and unbiased with respect
#: to insertion order, and it reads the whole table to get there — an explicit
#: choice, priced accordingly.
SYSTEMATIC = "systematic"

#: n rows per stratum of a named column (a partition key, a date). What a
#: date-range or reference-set question actually needs: a random sample of a
#: table whose rows are 99% one status value will not find the other four.
STRATIFIED = "stratified"
