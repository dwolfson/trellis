"""`data_class_match` and `reference_data_match` — the value-based half of
`postgres_column_profile` (design §5.4, Phase 1 slice 10).

Two questions, from `docs/multi-resource-questions-design.md` §5.4:

- **`data_class_match`** — "Which columns conform to a known Data Class (PII
  and otherwise), with what confidence — and which look like a class we do not
  have yet?"
- **`reference_data_match`** — "Which low-cardinality columns conform to a
  known reference-data set, and which should become one?"

Pure logic: no pyegeria, no psycopg2, no registry. The Egeria elements arrive
as `KnownDataClass` / `KnownValidValueSet` (built by `egeria_reference_catalog.py`
from what the platform actually holds) and the column values arrive as a list
plus the `SampleProvenance` that says where they came from. That split is what
makes every branch below testable with no live Postgres and no live Egeria —
neither of which this build environment has.

**Absence discipline.** The reason this module has a nine-value verdict
vocabulary rather than a boolean is that "no match" has at least four
genuinely different causes, and three of them are not answers:

- nothing was sampled (`catalog_stats_only`, or the engine cannot sample) —
  `MATCH_NOT_SAMPLED`;
- the platform holds no Data Classes / no Valid Value Sets to compare against
  — `MATCH_NO_CANDIDATES`;
- too few distinct values came back to support any claim, or the value list
  was truncated at the configured bound — `MATCH_INCONCLUSIVE`;
- values were read, candidates existed, and none conformed — `MATCH_NO_MATCH`,
  which is the only one of the four that is a *finding*.

Collapsing those into "no match found" is the defect
`docs/design-notes/DEFECT-UNBUILT-STAGES-RENDER-AS-BUILT.md` and the
`find-absence-as-answer` skill are both about, in the one place a column-level
PII claim would be read as reassurance.

**Every conformance claim is stated against the sample** (§5.8's second rule).
`ColumnMatch.describe()` refuses to produce an unqualified "conforms": the
fraction and the sample envelope are in the same sentence, always.

MATCH_UNMATCHED_PATTERNED = "unmatched_patterned"

def resolve_n_distinct(

    """Turn `pg_stats.n_distinct` into an actual distinct-value count.

    Postgres encodes three different things in one signed column, and reading
    it as a plain number is wrong in two of the three cases:

    - **> 0** — the estimated number of distinct values. Use as-is.
    - **< 0** — the negative of the distinct values' *fraction of the row
      count*, which Postgres uses when distinctness scales with table size (a
      unique key's `n_distinct` is `-1`). The real count is
      `-n_distinct * total_rows`, so reading `-1` as a count says "one distinct
      value" — the exact inverse of "every value is distinct", and it would put
      every primary key in the reference-data candidate set.
    - **0** — unknown. `None` here, never 0: a column with zero distinct values
      is an all-NULL column, which is a measurement, and this is the absence of
      one.

    A negative `n_distinct` with no `total_rows` to scale it by is also `None`:
    the fraction is known and the thing it is a fraction OF is not.

    **Provenance note.** Phase 1 slice 9 (`db_derived`) was to publish this as
    `_resolve_n_distinct`, and the brief for this slice says to reuse it rather
    than re-derive it. Slice 9 had not merged when this slice was built
    (`main` was at the probes-4/5 merge), so there was nothing to import — this
    is the same correction, written here as a public name so slice 9 and slice
    11 can import it instead of adding a third copy. If slice 9 lands its own,
    the two must be reconciled to one before both are in the tree; see
    `POSTGRES-COLUMN-PROFILE-IMPLEMENTED.md`.

    **Reconciliation note (round 3 design review, `stats_reset` fix).**
    `database_surveyor._resolve_n_distinct` gained a `stats_reset` parameter
    and a `reason` on its result so the "reltuples == 0, never analyzed"
    ambiguity can be told apart from "reltuples == 0, stats were reset"
    (see its docstring). This function does not need the same fix: its only
    caller (`column_profile_step.run_column_profile`) feeds it
    `profile["distinct_count"]` — the value `_resolve_n_distinct` already
    produced upstream, which is either `None` or a non-negative resolved
    count, never a raw negative-ratio `n_distinct`. The `value < 0` branch
    below never fires in practice; `reltuples`/`ever_analyzed`/`stats_reset`
    are not in scope here because the ambiguity they resolve was already
    settled (or deliberately left `None`) before this function ever sees the
    number. The two are still not reconciled to one (per the note above),
    but that gap and this one are independent — reconciling them is not
    required to close the `stats_reset` gap.
