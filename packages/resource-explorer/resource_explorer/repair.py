"""Repair operations for RE's repo inventory — Admin-surface actions that go
beyond add/remove: rename a repo's slug, correct its github_url, turn on a
collection type drift detection flagged, and fix up an investigation
membership that points at the wrong repo.

None of these existed before this module. Each one is a multi-step
orchestration across the registry (SQLite/Postgres), pgvector, and (for
rename) GitHub — see docs/repair-operations-design.md for what each has to
guarantee atomically and what it refuses rather than risk.

Vocabulary note (see the brief this module was built from): "project" in
this codebase's identifiers (`ProjectRegistry`, `project_slug`, the
`projects` table) means what current vocabulary calls a **repo**. This
module is new code, so its own names, docstrings, and CLI/API surface all
say "repo" — it does not rename the underlying registry symbols, which is a
separate, larger decision this module deliberately does not make.

    repo_dispositions, and sibling repos' parent_slug — see
    ProjectRegistry.rename_project_slug's own comment for the full
    enumeration) and its owned pgvector collection tables.

    Order matters and is chosen so a failure never leaves an orphan:
      1. Compute the rename plan (owned collections vs. shared ones left
         alone) — read-only, can't fail destructively.
      2. Rename each owned pgvector table. If any rename fails partway,
         the ones already renamed are rolled back (renamed back to their
         old name) before raising — so a failed rename_repo() leaves the
         registry and pgvector in the state they started in, not a mix.
      3. Only once every pgvector rename has succeeded, rename the SQL
         side in one transaction (ProjectRegistry.rename_project_slug).

    Investigation/working-set membership is entity_slug-keyed with
