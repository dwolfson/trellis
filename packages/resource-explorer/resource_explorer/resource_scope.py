"""The selection record for what a repository publishes (brief 2a, explicit selection).

**Selecting a folder never implies publishing what is nested in it. Publishing is of named items, previewed,
plus the ancestors needed to hold them. Worthiness is a proposal, never a decision.**

A choice is RE's record (`resource_scope_events`, append-only), saved before and apart from any publish.
`sub_resources` stays the record of what was PUBLISHED; nothing here writes it. This module is the one place
that turns the two records plus the sub-resource survey into the view both panes draw (Curate's "what's in
it" and the Analysis pane's sub-resource panel) and the manifest the commit table shows, so the screen's
counts are the record's counts and never the DOM's.

Pure reads: building a view writes nothing and calls nothing outside the registry.
