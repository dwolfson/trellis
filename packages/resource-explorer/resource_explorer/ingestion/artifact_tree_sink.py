"""Bridge from RE's ingestion walk to the shared containment tree.

Off by default (`ARTIFACT_TREE_ENABLED`). Off means today's behaviour exactly:
this module opens no connection, creates no table, and does no work.

On, it builds a tree per artifact **in addition to** the chunks that walk
already produces. Not instead of: chunks are retrieval units sized by content
profile, tree nodes are containment units that compression rungs are cut from,
and neither derives from the other (docs/context-compilation-design.md §15). The
two come from the same walk over the same files -- one read, two representations.

**Never breaks ingestion, and never lies about it.** A failure here does not
propagate -- a tree is an optimisation over a working pipeline and a broken one
must not cost the corpus -- but it is not swallowed into a success-shaped return
either. build_trees() hands back a TreeBuildResult carrying an explicit status,
so "the feature is off", "no adapter for this language", "some files were
skipped" and "the store was unreachable" are distinguishable outcomes rather
than four zeros. Returning a bare 0 for all of them is the exact shape
tests/test_no_silent_success.py ratchets against, and it was the first thing
this module got wrong.
