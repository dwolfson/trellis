class IncrementalIndexer:
    """
    Commit-diff based incremental update strategy:
      1. Fetch latest commit SHA from GitHub
      2. Compare against stored last_commit_sha in registry
      3. git diff --name-only last_sha..HEAD → list of changed files
      4. Determine which collection types are affected by the changed files
      5. Delete-then-reinsert just the changed files' chunks per affected
         collection (real row-level delete-by-filter — migration plan
         decision D4), falling back to collection-level drop+full-rebuild
         only where per-file precision doesn't apply: release_notes (chunks
         have no file_path — they're per-GitHub-release, not per-file) and
         doc collections drawing from extra_docs_paths (those chunks'
         file_path uses a different display-prefix scheme than the
         subproject-relative paths GitHub's compare API returns, so a
         precise match can't be guaranteed without risking a silent
         under-delete).

    Previously always re-indexed at collection granularity (drop + full
    rebuild) specifically because Milvus made delete-by-metadata-filter
    awkward on arbitrary schemas — pgvector makes it a plain SQL DELETE, so
    that workaround is gone for the common case.
