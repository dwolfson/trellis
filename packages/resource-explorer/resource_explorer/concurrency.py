"""One bounded shared thread pool per process, for bridging sync calls
(pyegeria's, BeeAI's) into and out of async code.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before this, six separate `ThreadPoolExecutor`s were constructed ad hoc
across the package (``agents/base.py``, ``agents/conversation_agent.py``
x2, ``surveyors/survey_definition_reader.py`` x2, ``surveyors/
prefect_adapter.py``, plus ``tui/app.py``), five of them per-call and one
of them (``prefect_adapter.py``) with **no ``max_workers`` at all**. Each
was individually small; together they had no cap, no shared accounting,
and no single place to bound a call. ``docs/process-model.md`` §1.3 has
the full inventory and the incident that motivated the change:
``resolve_question_guid()`` hanging 15+ seconds inside pyegeria's
``get_guid_for_name`` -> ``nest_asyncio`` -> ``run_until_complete`` frame
on 2026-09-03/04.

What replaces them: **one** pool per process, sized from config
(``EXPLORER_SYNC_POOL_SIZE``, default 8), with the per-call timeout that
contained that incident kept as defense in depth rather than dropped
because the pool is now shared.

The re-entrancy rule
--------------------
A shared bounded pool has a failure mode the throwaway pools did not: a
task that itself calls :func:`run_sync` can wait on a slot that only a
task behind it in the queue could free — a self-deadlock that appears
only under load. ``_resolve_question_guids`` was exactly this shape (a
pool of workers each opening its own one-worker pool).

Two things prevent it here:

1. Batch callers submit **leaf** work with :func:`submit_all`, never work
   that re-enters the pool.
2. :func:`run_sync` detects that it is *already running on a pool thread*
   (``_IN_POOL``) and runs the callable inline on that thread instead of
   submitting. Inline execution loses the timeout (there is no second
   thread to abandon), which is the honest trade: an unbounded wait in
   one already-owned slot beats a deadlock that stops every slot.

Abandoned workers, and why process exit needs help
--------------------------------------------------
On timeout the future is cancelled if it has not started; if it has, the
worker thread is *abandoned* — Python threads cannot be force-killed, and
joining one blocked in Egeria's client is precisely the hang being
avoided. Unlike the old throwaway pools (``shutdown(wait=False)`` and the
whole pool went with it), an abandoned worker here holds a slot in the
shared pool for as long as it stays stuck. :func:`stuck_worker_count`
reports how many, so the condition is observable rather than inferred
from things getting slow.

Abandonment is not free at interpreter shutdown, and this is the part
that bites. ``concurrent.futures.thread`` registers ``_python_exit`` with
``threading._register_atexit``, and that handler **joins every pool
worker**, whether or not the executor was shut down with ``wait=False``;
``threading._shutdown`` then waits on the same threads' shutdown locks
because pool workers are not daemon threads. So one worker stuck in
pyegeria's ``get_guid_for_name`` frame holds the whole process open —
forever, past every timeout, past a clean SIGTERM.

Observed live 2026-09-04 while verifying the worker role: the worker
logged "worker role stopped cleanly", released its advisory locks, and
then did not exit. The SIGUSR1 dump showed the main thread parked in
``_python_exit -> join`` behind two workers in the exact
``get_guid_for_name -> nest_asyncio -> select()`` frame from the
2026-09-03/04 incident. This is not new — the old per-call pools were
non-daemon threads in ``_threads_queues`` too, so
``shutdown(wait=False)`` never actually detached them either. It is
plausibly part of why that incident needed a ``kill -9`` after SIGTERM
was ignored for 8+ seconds.

Two things make abandonment real here:

* the pool's workers are **daemon threads**, so CPython's
  ``_thread_shutdown()`` does not wait for them. There is no supported
  way to daemonise a thread after it starts, and none to un-register it
  from that wait — but ``threading.Thread`` inherits ``daemon`` from the
  thread that *creates* it, and ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` creates its
  workers on whichever thread happens to submit. So :func:`get_pool`
  spawns all of them up front from one daemon thread
  (``_spawn_daemon_workers``) rather than letting them be created
  lazily by a request thread.
* :func:`detach_workers` removes them from
  ``concurrent.futures.thread._threads_queues``, which is what
  ``_python_exit`` iterates to join. That name is private and the call
  is guarded: if a future CPython renames it, exit degrades to the old
  join-and-hang rather than raising.
