"""The as-of date of each evidence section in a stored compile (docs/design-notes/BRIEF-CONTEXT-SECTION-AS-OF.md).

One place answers "how old was the evidence for section X", for the closed-loop diagnosis (`feedback_diagnosis`) and
the journal alike, so the three readers the brief names cannot drift apart again (§3d).

Where a date can be, in order of precedence:
- `manifest.as_of_seen`: the history a repeat compile keeps (§3h). Asked about a moment (`at`), the newest entry
  at or before it wins, so an answer is judged by the dates current when it was given. An entry with an empty
  `seen_at` holds the first compile's dates, from before any repeat.
- `packed[i].as_of` on an evidence entry (trellis-context 0.2.0): refreshed to the latest on every repeat.
- `manifest.declared[key].as_of`: where a declared section's date lived before 0.2.0, and still the only one in
  older manifests.

The pointer's `as_of` is not read. It says when the linked view's data is from, which is a different question.
