"""The gaps collection — findings about the ANALYSIS, owned by the project.

SPEC-ACTIONABLE-AND-HONEST.md §3: "A finding about the analysis belongs in a
gaps list the project owns." Two shapes land here, and only these two —
everything else about the repository names a `destination` instead (see
destinations.py):

    not_measurable   a check that ran (or could have) and could not be
                      established for this resource — result_status's
                      NOT_ESTABLISHED / "not_established" label.
    disagreement      two measures point different ways for the same
                      underlying question (today: community_support's
                      participation vs. chaoss_metrics' authorship
                      concentration — facts.py's `measures_disagree`, the
                      "existing disagreement computation" this reuses rather
                      than re-deriving).

`collect_gaps` is pure — it reads the same sources the page reads
(project_analysis_findings via query_findings, and the resource-state facts
in facts.py) and returns gap dicts. It never writes. `record_gaps_for` is the
one caller that turns that into persistence, upserting through
ProjectRegistry.upsert_gap — called from FactLayer.facts() (see that
module), the one choke point every consumer of "what is known about this
resource" already goes through, so the collection is current whenever the
page is without a second scheduler loop.
