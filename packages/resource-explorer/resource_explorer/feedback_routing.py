"""Route a diagnosis of a rated answer to the one consumer that acts on its cause.

docs/feedback-closed-loop-design.md §3.2 and BRIEF-CLOSED-LOOP-STEP2-ROUTING.md (step 2a: the gap consumers; step 2b:
the RFA consumers).
The rules, all decided by the project owner on 2026-11-10:

* **On Save.** A Save that sets or changes the cause routes it, in the same request, after the triage event is
  written. A status change alone routes nothing; the secondary cause never routes.
* **One route per (item, cause).** `feedback_routes` is keyed on the pair, and the route is claimed before any
  work, so a second Save, or two at once, cannot route it twice.
* **A re-diagnosis leaves the earlier route standing.** Its gap is real work someone may have started.
* **A failed route never fails the diagnosis.** A route that cannot be made for a lasting reason (no resource, no
  stored compile, nothing charged) is recorded as `none` with its reason; one that failed for a passing reason
  (a registry error) is released, so the next Save tries again.
* **The admin picks one charged analysis**, defaulting to the first in role order (`feedback_diagnosis.ROLE_ORDER`).
* **The gap sentence includes the question as asked; the asker's id never travels** into a gap.
* **Except in a private context** (Q8's limit; the architect's P1 read-back of 6c050de2): when the answer's resource
  is in a private investigation or restricted by its Egeria zones, or that cannot be told, the gap and the RFA name
  the item reference and the cause only. No question text in a sentence, a summary, the evidence or a key.
  `private_context` is the one test.

Step 2a: the gap consumers (`missing_evidence`, `analysis_defect`, and the gap half of `catalog_gap`).
Step 2c: Automate. A `stale` diagnosis proposes a schedule for the analysis behind the stale section, as an RFA whose
drawer row can save it, only ever making it faster (Q7). One proposal per (resource, analysis, cadence), in the same
`feedback_rfas` table, so a completed weekly proposal does not stop a later daily one; no question text. An analysis
that already runs daily and was still stale is an `analysis_defect` gap instead: the run, or its result's path to the
compile, is what failed (the architect's read-back of 0969661a).
Step 2b: the RFA consumers. `catalog_gap` also raises an RFA, attached to its gap (`analysis_gaps.rfa_activity_id`),
or against the `catalog`/`questions` pseudo-entity when the answer had no resource; `unclear_question` raises an RFA
only. One RFA per (question, cause, entity), claimed in `feedback_rfas` before it is written; a later answer on the
same question joins it. RFAs are raised unassigned (Q5).
