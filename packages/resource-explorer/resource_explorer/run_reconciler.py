"""Resolve activity rows left claiming "running" by a process that is gone.

A Survey Definition run happens in a `daemon=True` thread inside the web
process. Every way that thread can END writes a terminal status — executor
errors and unexpected crashes are both caught in
`_run_survey_definition_background`. Exactly one way it can STOP does not: the
process itself dying. A restart, a Ctrl-C, a kill, and the thread vanishes
mid-run with no chance to write anything.

The row then says "running" forever. Measured 2026-08-26: six such rows, the
oldest three days old, while the user could not tell whether a survey they had
just started was working. "Started, outcome unknown" rendered as "in progress"
is the same answer-shaped-non-answer this codebase keeps removing, sitting in
the one field someone checks when they are already unsure.

**Reconciled by ownership, not by age.** A running row records the pid and
process start time of whoever owns it, and is resolved only when that exact
process is provably gone. Age alone would be wrong here: a real Full Survey on
a large repo takes sixteen minutes, and two Resource Explorer processes can
share one database (a second one started on another port is routine during
development) — so a timeout generous enough to be safe would be too slow to be
useful, and a short one would kill live runs belonging to a peer process.

**`interrupted`, never `error`.** We know the run stopped; we do not know it
failed. Some of these had already written most of their findings. Calling that
an error would be a different false claim in place of the first one.

Fails safe throughout: a row whose owner cannot be determined is LEFT ALONE,
because "I cannot tell whether this is alive" must never resolve to "it is
dead".
