"""The CLI's side of the cached login.

`resource-explorer login` exchanges an Egeria password for a bearer token once,
wraps it in RE's own session JWT and caches that under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/trellis/resource-explorer/session.json` (mode 0600). Every
later command reads it back, so the CLI runs as the signed-in person rather
than as the `.env` service account — which is what makes Egeria's own
provenance record who did it (`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §4).

The file format, the location and the expiry check all live in
`trellis_auth.session_file`, shared verbatim with Egeria Advisor. What is
RE-specific and therefore here: the app name, minting the app JWT from RE's
own `AuthConfig`, and the two ways a command asks for the session —

  * `resolve_identity(explicit_user)` — best effort. Returns whoever we can
    name, for attribution and namespacing. A read-only command (`list`,
    `ask` against the local corpus, `runs list`) needs no Egeria and must not
    be blocked by a lapsed session.
  * `require_identity()` — hard requirement. Prints **exactly one line** and
    exits 2 when there is no live session, for commands that will make a live
    Egeria call and would otherwise fail deep inside pyegeria with a stack
    trace that names none of this.

Exit code 2 rather than 1, deliberately and identically to EA: 1 is "the
command ran and failed", 2 is "you are not signed in", and a script wrapping
the CLI can tell them apart without parsing the message.
