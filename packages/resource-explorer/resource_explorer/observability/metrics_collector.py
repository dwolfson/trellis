"""Query metrics — Postgres by default, SQLite when pointed at a file.

Was raw `sqlite3` until 2026-08-23: the last store in this package with no
portability layer, and the reason a `data/metrics.db` file kept being written
long after the registry moved to Postgres. It now uses the same SQLAlchemy
engine + ProjectRegistry.ConnectionWrapper pair the registry and FeedbackStore
use, which is what makes the SQL below backend-agnostic — the wrapper
translates `?` placeholders to `%s` and rewrites
`INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` to `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` on Postgres, so
none of the statements here needed changing.

"zero external dependencies" was the original justification for SQLite. That
stopped being true of the product as a whole once the registry required
Postgres; keeping metrics on a file only meant one more store nobody was
looking at.
