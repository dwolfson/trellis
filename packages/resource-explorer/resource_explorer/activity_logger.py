    /run) — the Analyses cards' equivalent of log_survey's Survey Definition
    tracking (2026-08-24: direct feedback that Analyses cards had no last-run
    signal at all, unlike Survey Definition cards). `detail` carries
    {"analysis_id": ...} as the join key, same convention as
    survey_definitions.py's survey_definition_ref — see
    registry.get_analysis_last_run().

    `published` is three-state, not a bool default-False: True (auto-publish
    attempted and succeeded), False (attempted and failed — the ☁ Publish
    button on this card should stay visible as a recovery action, findings
    are already stored, only the Egeria write needs retrying), or None
    (never attempted — unassigned resource or no annotations, same button
    stays visible as the only way to publish at all). See
    registry.get_analysis_last_run()'s `last_publish_failed`.

    `runner` (2026-08-30, backgrounded analysis-card runs): the owning
    process's identity (`run_reconciler.process_identity()`), embedded under
    `_runner` in `detail` exactly like `survey_definitions.py`'s
    `log_survey()` call does for its own 'running' row — this is the field
    `run_reconciler.owner_of()` reads to resolve a row left "running" by a
    process that died mid-run. Pass it only for the initial 'running' call;
    the terminal `update_activity_status()` overwrites `detail` and drops it,
    which is fine — a terminal row is never a reconciliation candidate."""

    `items` carries the same structured pointers an ordinary activity entry can
    (see renderActivityLog's link handling) — an RFA that says "3 publishes are
    stuck" is only actionable if it can also say where to look at them.

    The drawer is fed by GET /api/activity/rfas, which flattens activity entries
    and keeps only *annotations* whose annotation_type contains
    "RequestForAction". It does not look at operation="rfa" at all. This function
    wrote the entry with an empty annotations list, so every RFA it produced was
    invisible there — the entry existed in the activity log, and the surface
    built to act on it never showed it.

    That affected all three callers: Automate's change notifications
    (scheduler.py), Enrichment's context requests (web/routes/context.py), and
    Egeria linkage divergences (egeria_linkage.py). Each is a request for a human
    action that no human was shown.

    The annotation carries the same summary as the entry rather than a different
    one: the drawer reads the annotation's, the activity log reads the entry's,
    and two texts drifting apart for one event would be worse than the
    duplication.
