"""Filesystem reachability probe — Phase 1 slice #13
(COORDINATOR-BRIEF-MULTI-RESOURCE.md, egeria-support-for-multi-resource.md
§5/§9/§10).

Deferred by the project owner on 2026-09-21 ("defer the resource_
reachability table until further tests -- do not build it yet"); un-deferred
by the project owner on 2026-09-22, who asked for this slice to proceed
now. See `docs/design-notes/RESOURCE-REACHABILITY-IMPLEMENTED.md` for the
full write-up, including the live probe 7/8 results this module's mapping
is built from -- not guessed at.

**Scope: filesystem/folder resources only.** Probe 7 confirmed the
mechanism (`AutomatedCuration.initiate_gov_action_type("FileSurvey::
survey-folder", ..., request_parameters={"finalAnalysisStep": "CHECK_ASSET"})`
against a folder Asset) but ALSO surfaced a real, previously-unknown gap:
`EgeriaFileSystemSurveyor.catalog_and_survey`'s own `create_folder_element_
from_template()` call (the DataFolder template) attaches NO Connection to
the folder Asset it creates -- confirmed live, not inferred from the docs'
existing "no attached Connection subgraph" comment. Every filesystem RE has
ever cataloged this way will report `no_connection` from this check, not a
genuine reachability answer, until something gives the Asset a real
Connection (out of scope for this slice -- see the design notes doc's
"Not built" section). Database reachability was not probed here at all: the
design doc's own gap analysis (§5) is specifically about the folder-survey
CHECK_ASSET mechanism, and `survey-postgres-database` is a different
governance action type with a different failure shape (secrets-store
resolution, per PROBES-2026-09-21.md's probe 9 write-up) -- extending this
module to databases is future work, not assumed to work identically.

Live-verified request/response shapes (2026-09-22, scratch elements
cleaned up, `PROBES-2026-09-21.md`'s "Probes 7 and 8, run live" section):

  * No Connection at all on the folder Asset -> terminal status `INVALID`,
    completion message starting `OPEN-SURVEY-0009 ... has no connection,
    so there is no way to reach the resource`. Fast (~6s including the
    initial connect/poll overhead).
  * A Connection present but pointing at a path the *engine host's own*
    filesystem cannot see (e.g. a macOS host path when the engine host is
    a Docker container) -> terminal status `FAILED`, completion message
    `OMES-SURVEY-ACTION-0018 ... FileException ... BASIC-FILE-CONNECTOR-
    404-001 The folder named <path> ... does not exist`. Fast (~3s).
  * A Connection present and pointing at a path the engine host CAN see
    -> terminal status `COMPLETED`, completion message
    `OMES-SURVEY-ACTION-0019 ... completed the analysis ... in <N>
    milliseconds`. Fast (~3.4s in the live run, an empty folder).

All three completed in single-digit seconds -- confirms the design doc's
"that probe is cheap" claim for every outcome, not just the reachable one.
