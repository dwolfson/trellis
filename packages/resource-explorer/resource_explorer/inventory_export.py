"""Export the resource inventory — everything needed to rebuild it from scratch.

Nothing today can reproduce the inventory if the store is lost. That is a gap on
its own, and it also blocks two planned pieces of work
(`docs/resource-vocabulary-rename-plan.md` §4): a pgvector wipe-and-reingest, and
the `project` → `resource` rename, whose only genuinely hard part is that slugs
are baked into live vector-store collection names. With an export, the wipe
becomes safe and the rename's hard part disappears — there is no data to migrate
if the data is being rebuilt.

**Registrations, not derivations.** Chunks, embeddings, survey results, code
symbols and containment trees are all rebuilt by re-ingesting; exporting them
would be exporting the expensive thing rather than the irreplaceable one. What
cannot be rebuilt is the human input: which resources someone chose to register,
what they were called, how they were grouped, and which investigation they belong
to.

**An empty export is indistinguishable from an empty inventory.** So every
section is counted in a manifest, and `verify()` checks the counts against the
sections. A truncated or partly-failed export should be loud rather than look
like a small estate.
