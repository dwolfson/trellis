"""Encryption at rest for `databases.db_password` (registry.py).

Design context
---------------
`docs/design-notes/REPLY-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` §7
(the architecture session's ruling on the `ASK-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-
CAPABILITY-VISIBILITY.md` question): pyegeria only exposes
`save_client_side_secret`/`delete_client_side_secret` — there is no read API
for secrets, so RE's local execution path cannot resolve credentials through
Egeria and `databases.db_password` cannot simply be dropped in favor of the
`.omsecrets` file. §7's actual recommendation is *encrypt it in place*, not
relocate it: "RE's own `databases.db_password` should stop being a
clear-text column and become RE's own store (encrypted at rest, or the OS
keychain)". This module is the "encrypted at rest" half of that — the
`.omsecrets` projection lives in `omsecrets_store.py`.

Why Fernet (`cryptography`, already a pyproject.toml dependency — no new
dependency needed)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
`cryptography>=43.0.0` is already required by this package (see
pyproject.toml; pulled in via `packages/trellis-auth`'s JWT signing).
`cryptography.fernet.Fernet` is the smallest adequate primitive already on
hand: authenticated symmetric encryption (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 under
the hood), a URL-safe base64 wire format that drops straight into a TEXT
column, and no new key-management surface beyond "one 32-byte key". A
password-hashing KDF (bcrypt/argon2) would be the wrong tool — those are
one-way, and this value must be recovered in plaintext to open a database
connection. Nothing heavier (envelope encryption, a KMS integration) is
justified for a single-host dev tool whose credential store already lives
in a shared Postgres/SQLite registry the operator controls.

Key management — mirrors `auth.jwt_secret()`
----------------------------------------------
Same two-env-var-then-derive shape as the app-JWT secret
(`resource_explorer/auth.py::jwt_secret()`, itself matching Egeria Advisor):
`RE_DB_CREDENTIAL_KEY` then `TRELLIS_DB_CREDENTIAL_KEY`, and if neither is
set, a stable per-host key derived from the hostname (logged once, loudly —
a real deployment is expected to set the variable; the derived key means
already-encrypted rows stay readable across a process restart but not a
migration to a different host). The key is never stored in the `databases`
table alongside the ciphertext it protects — it lives only in the process
environment (or the derived-from-hostname fallback), never in the registry.
