"""
pgvector (PostgreSQL) vector store backend for Resource Explorer.

PgVectorStore is now a thin adapter over the shared trellis-vectorstore
package (packages/trellis-vectorstore/) — extracted alongside Egeria
Advisor's independently-evolved equivalent (advisor/vector_store_pg.py).
See docs/trellis-vectorstore-extraction.md for the full design rationale.
This adapter's entire job is reproducing RE's exact pre-extraction
behavior: cosine distance (not EA's L2 default — RE's existing min_score
threshold semantics were calibrated against Milvus's COSINE/FLAT setup,
migration plan decision D2), a named Postgres schema (not EA's unqualified
`public`, decision D1), and no per-collection extra scalar columns (RE's
uniform 4-column schema, unlike EA's `pyegeria`/`pyegeria_cli`).

MultiCollectionStore below is unchanged — it stays package-local per the
extraction design (RE's and EA's MultiCollectionStore are different
abstractions wearing the same name; only BaseVectorStore/SearchResult/
PgVectorStore moved to the shared package).

Two classes:
  - PgVectorStore: RE's adapter over the shared implementation, same public
    constructor signature as before extraction — every existing call site
    (`PgVectorStore(schema=...)` in tests/conftest.py, the migration
    script) keeps working unmodified.
  - MultiCollectionStore: thin compatibility wrapper preserving the exact
    public method names/signatures the ~15 existing call sites already use
    (search/insert/drop_collection/count/list_source_files/collection_name),
    so this migration is a mechanical import swap at every call site rather
    than a rewrite of the callers themselves.

    0, so one added chunk shifted every later id, and two refreshes could give different files' chunks the same id
