"""Resource Explorer's thin adapter over the shared `trellis-auth` package.

RE's counterpart to `advisor/auth.py`. Deliberately *thin*, and deliberately
the same shape as EA's — the project has been bitten before by two apps
growing two answers to one question (query cache, annotation properties, the
Portal token contract itself), and "how do I know who is calling" is exactly
that kind of question.

What is here
------------
* `get_policy()` — RE's resolved `trellis_auth.AuthPolicy`
  (`resolve_policy("EXPLORER")`, so `TRELLIS_*` then `EXPLORER_*`), plus RE's
  own public paths.
* `auth_config()` — the `AuthConfig` carrying RE's secrets and Egeria
  connection, resolved from `RE_JWT_SECRET` / `RE_PORTAL_SECRET` (the two the
  A2A role already reads — see `a2a_auth.settings_from_env`) and
  `config.egeria`.
* token mint/decode/exchange and `login_with_password`, all pure delegation.

**One identity mechanism per app.** RE already had a request-scoped caller for
the A2A role (`a2a_auth.CallerIdentity` + the `current_caller` ContextVar).
This module does *not* add a second one: `identity_from_claims()` turns an app
JWT's claims into exactly that `CallerIdentity`, and `IdentityMiddleware` in
`web/app.py` sets the same ContextVar the A2A middleware sets. Downstream code
therefore has one question to ask — `a2a_auth.caller()` — whether the call
arrived over HTTP, over A2A, or from the CLI.

**What is deliberately NOT here**: a service-account fallback that turns an
anonymous request into a live Egeria call as `erinoverview`. The worker role's
own loops build service-account clients directly (bootstrap, resync, outbox
drain — see `egeria_identity.py`); nothing on a request path may quietly
borrow that identity, which is the 2026-08-29 decision that artifact ownership
requires an authenticated identity with no config fallback.

class _AuthSecretsConfig(BaseSettings):
    """`.env`-aware source for the four auth env vars below.

    This module used to read all four straight from `os.environ`, bypassing
    pydantic-settings (and therefore `.env`) entirely — the only settings in
    the package that did. That is exactly the bug shape `config.py` documents
    twice over (`_ENV_FILES`'s own comment, ~line 14): a value set only in
    `.env` was silently invisible, no error, just a fallback (a derived
    per-host JWT secret, or Portal SSO silently and wrongly "disabled").
    Found live 2026-09-06 on an install where the operator set RE_JWT_SECRET
    in `.env`, restarted, and the log still said neither var was set.

    Reusing `config.py`'s `_ENV_FILE_CONFIG` (same `_ENV_FILES` tuple, same
    `extra="ignore"`) rather than inventing a second mechanism — this is the
    nested-BaseSettings pattern every other alias-based setting in the
    package already uses, fixed there 2026-08-10 for exactly this reason.
    `load_dotenv()` was considered and rejected: it would be a second,
    parallel way of reading `.env` alongside pydantic-settings' own, and
    this package has already been bitten twice (see `_ENV_FILES`'s comment)
    by two answers to "how does `.env` get read" drifting apart.

    Deliberately NOT one field per secret with `AliasChoices("RE_X",
    "TRELLIS_X")`: pydantic-settings resolves an `AliasChoices` field
    independently *per source* (env vars, then dotenv, ...) and then picks
    the highest-priority source that produced any value at all — so a real
    `TRELLIS_JWT_SECRET` env var would outrank an `RE_JWT_SECRET` set only in
    `.env`, silently inverting the RE-wins-over-TRELLIS precedence this
    module has always documented. Two plain fields, combined by the
    `X or Y` below, keep that precedence explicit in the code instead of
    implicit in alias-resolution order — same shape the raw `os.environ`
    version used, just backed by a source that also reads `.env`.

    Cached at module scope (`_auth_secrets()` below) rather than
    instantiated per call: `auth_config()` runs on every authenticated
    request (`get_current_user`, `decode_token`, ...), and re-reading `.env`
    off disk that often would trade a bypassed-`.env` bug for a per-request
    file read. `reset_auth_secrets_cache()` exists so tests can vary the
    environment, same pattern as `reset_policy_cache()`.
