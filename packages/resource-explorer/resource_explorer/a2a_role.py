"""The `a2a` process role — every agent on one port, behind one bearer token.

`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §2 names five process roles and says of
this one:

    RE already has one: `agentstack_server.py` runs each specialist agent
    (orchestrator, stats, code, docs, health, compare, integration) as its own
    A2A endpoint on ports 8080 to 8086 via `resource-explorer serve`. It has
    **no authentication at all** today and its one-port-per-agent layout is
    awkward in compose. It becomes a role: one service, one port, agents routed
    by path, the same Egeria bearer token (§4) accepted on every call ... and
    an agent card published per app.

This module is that role. `run_a2a(host, port, stop_event)` follows
`worker.py`'s shape: it blocks until the stop event is set, shuts down within a
bound, and the CLI wraps it with SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers and the shared
SIGUSR1 thread dump.

Routing: why a Starlette/FastAPI root and not the SDK
-----------------------------------------------------
The agentstack SDK **cannot** host more than one agent on one server.
`Server.agent()` raises ``ValueError("Server can have only one agent.")`` on a
second registration, and `Server.serve()` builds and owns its own uvicorn — one
agent, one port, by construction. (RE design rule 8 has said so since Project
Explorer; this is that rule re-confirmed against agentstack-sdk 0.7.1, not
assumed from it.)

What the SDK *does* support, one layer down, is building an agent's ASGI app
without the server around it: `agentstack_sdk.server.app.create_app(agent, ...)`
returns a plain FastAPI application (the A2A REST app, with the A2A JSON-RPC app
already mounted at `/jsonrpc`). Those mount under a path prefix like any other
ASGI app. So the layout is:

    /                             the orchestrator — the default agent
    /.well-known/agent-card.json  its card
    /.well-known/agents.json      the index of all seven (this module's own)
    /whoami                       who the presented token says you are
    /agents/<name>/              each specialist's A2A REST surface
    /agents/<name>/v1/message:send          …its REST send endpoint
    /agents/<name>/jsonrpc/                 …its JSON-RPC endpoint
    /agents/<name>/.well-known/agent-card.json   …its card

The orchestrator is mounted twice, at `/agents/orchestrator` and at `/`, so it
is both addressable by name like every other agent and the default at the root.
It is one app object mounted at two paths, not two apps: two would mean two task
stores, and a task created through one URL would be invisible through the other.

Mount order matters: the `/` mount matches everything, so it is added last,
after the index route and the named mounts. Starlette resolves routes in the
order they were added.

Discovery
---------
`/.well-known/agents.json` is this module's own addition, not an A2A standard
path. The standard gives you one card per agent at each agent's own
`/.well-known/agent-card.json`; it gives a client no way to learn that six more
agents exist alongside the one it found. The index closes that: name, URL, card
URL, description, skills, the required auth scheme, RE's version, and the Egeria
platform this service is bound to — enough for a Portal or an external
orchestrator to decide which agent to call and how to authenticate to it,
in one fetch.

Both it and the per-agent cards are readable **without** a token; everything
else needs one. See `a2a_auth.is_public_path` for why.
