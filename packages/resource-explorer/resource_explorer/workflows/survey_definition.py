"""Running an authored Survey Definition, off any web framework.

Unlike the other three workflows, this one was never really web-only: the CLI
and `web/routes/survey_definitions.py` already called the same core
`run_survey_definition` (plan §3 names that as the evidence the core is
separable). What lived only in the route was the small amount *around* it — the
portal-URL decoration, and the "write the terminal status back onto the activity
entry" wrapper the frontend's poll depends on.

That wrapper is what the run queue needs, so it moves here rather than being
reimplemented: a queued Survey Definition run must leave exactly the same
activity row a route-spawned thread left, or the run modal reads a different
shape depending on which process happened to execute it.
