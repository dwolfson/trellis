"""GitHub discovery — search, list-load, org expansion, disposition, sources.

Moved out of `web/routes/discovery.py` in step 2b. The plan (§3) names this as
one of three things that were "web-only today": there was no core module for
discovery at all, so a `resource-explorer discovery search` was impossible even
though nothing about searching GitHub needs a web server.

Two changes of shape were unavoidable in the move, and both are deliberate:

* **`async` became sync.** The route helpers were `async def` and used
  `asyncio.to_thread` to get the blocking PyGithub calls off the event loop.
  That is a property of *being called from an event loop*, not of the work, so
  the workflow functions are plain synchronous calls and the routes keep the
  `to_thread` hop. A CLI or a queue worker then does not have to start a loop
  to search GitHub.
* **`HTTPException` became `DiscoveryError`.** A workflow must not know about
  status codes. `DiscoveryError` carries the same distinction the route needed
  — `kind` says whether the problem was the caller's query, GitHub's
  auth/rate-limit, or GitHub being unhappy — and `discovery.py` maps that back
  onto 400/502 exactly as before.
