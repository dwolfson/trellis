"""Catalogue →: the commit behind the Curate screen, run asynchronously.

The design's three consequences of Curate being a handoff rather than a
state change inside RE: the commit is asynchronous and can fail elsewhere;
"running · N targets" is read, not known; after Curate RE is not the
source of truth. So the commit is a queued run, each step writes its
outcome to the curation record as it lands, and the screen shows the
record. Nothing here raises past a step: a step that fails is a failed
step on the record, and the next step runs unless it depends on it.

Steps, in order:
  publish_asset     publish the survey already kept (never a survey run by
                    the press; an optional box re-surveys the stale steps
                    first) -- creates or finds the repository's own Asset and
                    links a SurveyReport (measurements LINKED, not copied)
  classifications   enrichment judgements COPIED onto the asset as
                    Confidentiality / Criticality / Retention, with the
                    author as steward and the date in the notes -- they
                    exist nowhere else
  sub_resources     the worthy sub-resources the person confirmed, as
                    FileFolder/DataFile assets under the repo's
  components        skipped here: accepted components materialize when
                    they are accepted (workflows/curate.py); the record
                    says so rather than pretending to have done it

**Decision (project owner, 2026-09-20):** pressing Catalogue used to run
`SurveyOrchestrator(...).run(slug, steps=None)` unconditionally -- every
sub-surveyor, every time, regardless of whether fresh data already sat in
Egeria. The project owner's framing: "it shouldn't have to execute all of
the surveys anyway -- it's likely that the surveys that the user is
interested in have already been published to Egeria? And why would we
execute and run surveys that the user isn't interested in?"

`publish_asset` now reuses the freshness gate `assess_freshness()`
(`workflows/analysis.py`) already applies elsewhere (Assessment/Analysis
cards, the scheduler) instead of introducing a second one: it reads
`registry.get_analysis_last_run("repo", slug)` for this repo's run
history and re-surveys only the analyses that are BOTH (a) something
someone has actually run before and (b) currently stale by
`RunsConfig.freshness_seconds`.

Two things follow from "someone has actually run before":

* An analysis with NO run history at all is excluded from the re-survey
  list even though it would trivially count as "stale" (there is no
  last-run timestamp for it to be fresh against). Catalogue must not be
  the thing that runs an analysis for the very first time -- that is
  running a survey nobody asked for, exactly the complaint above. A
  first-ever press of Catalogue, with no history for anything at all, is
  different (see below): there is nothing yet to be selective ABOUT, so
  that one case still runs a full survey once.
* A step whose last run was recorded as `error` still counts as "having
  run history" (it is a key in `get_analysis_last_run`'s result), so it
  stays eligible for re-running -- `assess_freshness` already treats an
  error run as not-fresh, so it gets re-run. Refusing to retry a step
  that failed last time is not a behaviour anyone wants.

Most of the time the re-survey list comes back short or empty:
`workflows/analysis.py`'s auto-publish already pushes an individual
analysis's results to Egeria the moment it runs, for any repo with
`has_assigned_egeria_project("repo", slug)` -- which is Catalogue's own
precondition a few lines below. So by the time a curator reaches
Catalogue, most analyses that ever ran have typically already been
published; freshness is what's left to decide. The one edge case that
assumption doesn't cover -- an analysis ran before the Egeria project was
ever assigned to this repo, so its data is fresh but was never actually
published -- is handled explicitly: if nothing is stale but this repo has
no cached Egeria asset guid yet, the survey still runs (with an empty
`steps=[]`, since nothing needs re-computing) purely so
`EgeriaPublisher.publish()` can find-or-create the asset; that call is
idempotent (`_find_or_create_asset`), so making it defensively is cheaper
than trying to prove up front that it is unnecessary.

    Only analyses with run history are ever candidates — an analysis
    nobody has ever run is excluded outright, never treated as "stale",
    so Catalogue can't be the thing that runs it for the first time. An
    analysis whose last run errored still has run history (it is a key
    in ``get_analysis_last_run``'s result) and is therefore still a
