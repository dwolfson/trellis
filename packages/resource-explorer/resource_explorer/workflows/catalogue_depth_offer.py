"""The layer-2 catalogue-depth offer — DepthOffer's three rules, applied to
component materialization instead of never-run analyses (owner's ruling,
2026-09-15, on the designer's REPLY-CATALOGUE-IN-LAYERS.md §3).

Layer 1 is the catalogue commit itself (`workflows/curate_commit.py`) — the
repository's own capability, published. Layer 2 is promoting the ACCEPTED
architecture-recovery verdicts into real Egeria `SolutionComponent`s
(`surveyors/arch_recovery/materializer.py`). This module answers "should the
pane offer that next step, and what would it cost" — never whether to do it;
the offer is read-only, same as `build_depth_offer`.

DepthOffer's three rules, verbatim:

- **Not a nag** — offered once per catalogue record, in the pane, never a
  modal (`Curations.record_layer2_offer` refuses a second write, the same
  shape `registry.record_depth_offer` already refuses).
- **Not a gate** — layer 1 is already recorded when this offer appears;
  nothing here waits on an answer, and declining changes nothing about what
  was already committed.
- **Not a scold** — "N components recovered, M not catalogued" is a fact
  about the record, not an instruction. This module states the fact; the
  imperative voice belongs to nobody.

**The price has a basis DepthOffer's sibling in curate_plan.py's bulk-accept
dialog does not (yet)**: `egeria_call_timings` (added alongside this module,
owner's ruling the same day) records real per-write Egeria timing, keyed on
`call_name`/`kind` — `create_solution_component`/`write` is exactly the write
this offer prices. Until enough of those rows exist, the price is the SAME
honest fallback the bulk-accept dialog already uses ("not yet measured — the
first materialization is what fixes it") — never a declared or invented
number standing in for a real measurement, the same rule `RunCost.basis`
enforces for analysis runs.

Kept pure and registry-only (no FastAPI import), same reasoning as
`depth_offer.py`'s own docstring gives for the identical choice.
