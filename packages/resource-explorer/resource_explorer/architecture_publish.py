"""Publish for a repository's architecture: the one verb that writes accepted components and blueprints to Egeria.

Accept and Reject are decisions only (owner, 2026-10-09: "Publish should be the verb to save to Egeria";
the owner's 2026-10-08 ruling that Publish is the one Egeria verb). This module answers two questions from RE's own rows, with no Egeria call:

* `publish_plan`  what a press would write: every accepted component with no Egeria element yet, and every
  accepted blueprint with no element yet or whose compositions are not all confirmed. Shown BEFORE the press
  and used by the run, so the list and the write cannot drift.
* `last_results`  what the last press did, per item, from the proof rows the run wrote (`architecture_publish`).

`run_publish` is the write. It re-reads the plan at run time, writes only items still in it, and records one
proof row per item: done, skipped (already there), failed (with Egeria's sentence) or partial (written, but
not all of it confirmed). A reject never writes: RE has no delete path, so a rejected item already in Egeria
is only SAID to be still there.

No DDL: a blueprint verdict's shape and identifier choices ride in the verdict row's `retyped_to` (unused by
a blueprint verdict) as JSON.
