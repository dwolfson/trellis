"""Rebuild a repository's chat index from scratch, alongside the live one, then swap (BRIEF-REINDEX-FROM-SCRATCH.md, R1b).

The rules, all decided by the project owner or required by the architect's read-backs (2026-11-10):

* **Asked first, admins only, one at a time.** A run-queue row of kind `reindex` with the requester recorded. Refused
  while the repository has a first index or rebuild queued or running, while any other rebuild runs, or while an
  earlier rebuild's previous index is still kept (its names would collide).
* **Build aside.** Each collection type the analyzer proposes TODAY (Q1, re-plan) is ingested into
  `{slug}_{type}__rebuild`, with chunk ids minted under the live name (`vector_store_pg.insert(id_collection=)`), from
  one download at a recorded commit. Chat keeps reading the live index.
* **Check.** Old and new counts per type; a type that had chunks and is still proposed but now has none is refused;
  each built table must own its vector index.
* **The first rebuild ever is held** for an admin to accept (Q7), and timed; later ones go straight on.
* **Survey writes after the check, before the swap** (Q6, the architect's Q6 points): the pipeline's other writers, from
  a download of the same commit. Not undone by an undo. Each is listed in the result.
* **The swap, recoverably** (C3 as accepted): projects.collections is PRUNED of dropped types before the swap, the
  tables and their indexes are swapped in one transaction (`swap_collections`), then the list is EXTENDED with added
  types. A reader never sees a list entry for a missing table. The query cache is invalidated after each list change.
  The phase is written on the run row before and after each step, so `recover` can finish forward or roll back.
* **Votes** are snapshotted before the swap and carried after it (`chunk_votes`); every move is kept for undo.
* **The previous index is kept 7 days** (Q4) under `{name}__previous`; undo restores it (and its votes) in the mirror
  order; a later job drops it (R1c).
* **No project-status writes.** A failed rebuild is recorded on its run row, never as the project's ERROR, since its live
  index still serves.
