"""Compile a context for a question about one resource — the adoption gate.

Closes the loop opened in Phase 0. `question_catalog_reader.get_questions()`
already resolves Purpose + Perspective to questions and to the `analysis_ids`
that answer them, and already returns that chain as a `derivation`. Here those
analysis ids become the SECTIONS of a ContextSpec, the registry's materialised
findings become the packer's candidates, and the packer decides what fits.

**Nothing is run here.** Resolvers read stored analysis results only. An analysis
that has not run yet produces no candidate, and the packer reports it as a gap
rather than the context quietly lacking it — which is the whole point of
`availability: inline | queued` (docs/context-compilation-design.md §20). A
compile must never block on a survey.

**The derivation travels with the answer.** It is the explanation with content —
"this section is here because your Purpose is Certify, which ranked Q17, which
dispatches security_scan" — and it is what makes the manifest legible rather
than a list of sizes.

#: Kept small on purpose: an instructions section that grows into a system
#: prompt is a prompt template wearing a spec's clothes.
#:
#: The refusal wording is deliberately the ORIGINAL loose one. A one-shape
#: template ("reply in exactly this shape and add nothing else: 'The stored
#: analyses do not cover X. <analysis> would answer it; it <state>.'") was
#: tried in experiment run3-20260909 and over-triggered on the 8B answering
#: model: 107 of 156 compiled answers became pure refusals, including ones
#: where the analysis that answers the question was packed at FULL with no
#: gaps, and the <state> slot was filled by invention ("ran and found
#: nothing" for a packed analysis) in 7 of the run's 8 missing-result
#: claims. docs/experiments/compiled-vs-rag.md, run 3.
#:
#: The 'structure only' sentence was replaced 2026-09-10 (audit
#: docs/experiments/audits/2026-09-09-run4-unsupported-claims-vs-packed-text.md,
#: pattern A): telling the model that a section "is not a result" did not stop
#: it narrating `architecture_recovery`'s field names as an architecture, and
#: for the section that WOULD have answered the question (row 16,
#: `dependency_analysis`) it left the model with nothing but names, so it
#: answered from a neighbouring section instead. The rung now carries real
#: first entries, so the instruction it needs is about partiality, not about
#: non-results.
_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "Answer using only the evidence below. Every section states which analysis "
    "produced it. A section marked 'abridged' shows only the first few entries "
    "of each list or mapping — its counts and entries are partial, so do not "
    "report an abridged list as complete. If the evidence does not answer the "
    "question, say so and name what is missing — do not infer from absence."
)
#: A sentence asking yes/no answers to carry their evidence line was added
#: here by PR #38 (run 8) and removed after run 9's within-run A/B
#: (2026-09-12): it cost one evidence section a rung in 135 of 156 compiles
#: (instructions are a required section, so 202 characters of instruction
#: are 202 characters less evidence), and even where packing was identical
#: it made the 8B answerer terser everywhere (supported claims -0.58 paired,
#: median answer 114 vs 180 chars) for a gain on two of three CVE rows. It
#: survives as INSTRUCTION_VARIANTS["yesno_line"] so a later A/B can retest
#: it, e.g. with a larger model. The general lesson: every instruction
#: character is paid for in evidence, so an instruction has to beat the
#: rung it displaces.

#: The same instructions at the packer's SUMMARY rung, for budgets too small
#: to carry the template. Instructions are required, so without a shorter
#: rung a tight budget fails the compile outright instead of degrading — the
#: one section that used to be exempt from the ladder now climbs it too.
_INSTRUCTIONS_SHORT = (
    "Answer only from the evidence below; name the analysis behind each point. "
    "'Abridged' sections show first entries only. If it does not answer, say "
    "which analysis would and whether it has run. Do not infer from absence."
)

#: The barest form, for a budget too small even for the short one. Added
#: 2026-09-10 with the coverage line: instructions are REQUIRED, so every
#: character added to the top of that section is a budget below which the
#: whole compile raises instead of degrading. A third rung is what keeps the
#: ladder's promise for the one section that cannot be dropped.
_INSTRUCTIONS_BARE = (
    "Answer only from the evidence below; 'abridged' sections are partial. "

#: Named instruction variants, so an experiment can put two instruction
#: wordings in ONE run over the same stored state -- the within-run A/B that
#: run 8 (2026-09-12) showed is the only design that attributes anything
#: here: between two runs the Automate scheduler re-surveys the repos and
#: the catalog moves, so run-over-run comparisons carry three variables.
#: The variant changes the instructions candidate's text, so it is part of
#: the compile id without any further bookkeeping; the manifest names it.
#: "default" is production (plain, since run 9); "yesno_line" adds run 8's
#: sentence, so it can be retested without editing production wording.

    "If the question asks yes or no, give the yes or no and then the evidence "
    "line it rests on — the analysis, the value, and any coverage limit or caveat "

#:
#: Uncapped, ~26 sections share 6000 chars, the budget pins at its ceiling in

#: found the model narrating as if it were the answer (cause B/C: "649
#: component(s) exist… documented in the architecture summary"). Twelve is

    The findings table is one of several places results live, and for most
    analyses it is the wrong one. Measured on egeria_git 2026-08-29: eleven
    analyses were reported as gaps and seven of them had real stored data —
    repository_health scoring 85.8, api_structure holding 3,232 Java classes —
    because each keeps its results in its own table (project_stats,
    project_code_symbols, project_file_type_counts) and only
    `project_analysis_findings` was consulted. `docs/granularity-pass.md` §1.2
    had already measured that 12 analyses have no finding `kind` at all.

    The shapes are heterogeneous by design, so the rungs are structural rather
    than field-aware: FULL is the payload flattened to one `- key: value` line
    per field, SUMMARY is the same fields with only the first few entries of
    each list/mapping (marked as such), IDENTIFIERS names the parts. A reader
    that knew each shape would be a fourth place to keep that knowledge in
    sync — which is why the per-analysis HEADLINE function, not this, supplies
    the one field-aware sentence a section gets (see compile_context).

    FULL was a fenced ```json dump until 2026-09-10. The run-4 audit's pattern
    B is what changed it: `cve_scan`'s `{"checked": 0, "unqueryable": 61,
    "findings": []}` was read as "the CVE scan found no vulnerabilities", and
    `repository_health`'s nested `detail` produced "65964 stars, forks,
    watchers" from `stars: 65964` / `forks: 4745`. Flat, one fact per line,
    with nesting spelled out as `detail.forks`, removes the two structural
    invitations to that: a wall of braces to skim, and sibling numbers whose
    keys are visually far from their values.

    ONE exception, and it is a shape, not an analysis: `{"findings": [...]}`
    with `check_name`/`label`/`summary` per item is the same finding shape
    `_findings_to_rungs` already formats well from the findings table itself
    -- `_documentation_results`, `_license_results`,
    `_repo_classification_results` and others return exactly this ("same
    uniform finding shape" is their own recurring comment). Measured
    2026-08-31: documentation_coverage's SUMMARY read
    "- findings: 4 item(s)\n- _status: 5 key(s)", and the model narrated
    that structural summary verbatim as "5 key(s) with 4 item(s) found" --
    real per-check content, reduced to two counts, then repeated back as if
    it meant something. Recognizing this one recurring shape and reusing
    `_findings_to_rungs`' own formatting is not the field-aware special-
    casing above rules out; it is not re-deriving from `_status` or any
    other field this function still treats structurally.
