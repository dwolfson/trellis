"""Batch import/export of resources as CSV — an inventory that is also a scorecard.

Registering resources one at a time does not scale to the corpus sizes that
actually surface bugs: of the nine repos here with a derived homepage, three
exhibited shapes nobody anticipated (a meta-refresh stub, a homepage pointing at
the code forge, a dead domain). Breadth is the limiting factor, so loading it has
to be cheap.

**The one rule that keeps this honest: import reads intent, never state.**

Two kinds of column live in this file and they have opposite lifecycles:

  * *Intent* — what a human decided: which resources to track, what group they
    belong to, what disposition they have been given. Stable, hand-edited,
    meaningful to re-apply.
  * *Observed state* — what RE found: whether something is registered, cataloged
    in Egeria, when it was last surveyed. Derived, changes without anyone
    touching the file, and already has a source of truth in the registry.

Every observed column is prefixed `status_` and is **ignored on import**. Without
that rule the format is ambiguous in a way that cannot be resolved later: is
`status_surveyed_at=2026-08-01` a record of something that happened, or an
instruction to make it so? Worse, an export taken on Tuesday still asserts
`status_cataloged=yes` on Friday after Egeria was reset — a file that looks like
a record while being wrong. Reading state back in would let that fiction write
itself into the registry.

So the export is a superset of the import: it round-trips, it is reviewable in a
spreadsheet, it can be sliced by group to ask "did every ASF repo fail homepage
derivation?" — and re-importing it is exactly as safe as re-importing the list
you started from.

Disposition is deliberately on the *intent* side even though it is also current
state, because it is a human judgement rather than an observation: bulk-tagging a
cohort as `tracking` is a real thing to want, and disposition is keyed by URL so
it can be set before a resource is ever registered.
