"""RFA -> Egeria ToDo sync (docs/rfa-egeria-todo-followup.md).

The RFA drawer's defer/reassign/complete/reopen actions write a local
`rfa_actions` row first (authoritative for the API response, never blocked
on Egeria's reachability) and then attempt to create/update a real Egeria
`ToDo` behind it — same non-blocking try/except/log shape as
`egeria_publisher.py`'s activity-log write, since a failed Egeria call must
never fail the user's local action.

Unlike the activity log (a pure audit trail that can afford "log and
forget"), RFA/ToDo state is live workflow truth both systems must agree on
— `scheduler.py`'s background loop runs `reconcile_rfa_actions()` every
iteration to retry failed writes and pull in changes made by other Egeria
clients, closing the gap a one-shot sync attempt alone would leave.

Real, standing limitation (docs/rfa-egeria-todo-followup.md open question
#1, not solved here): RE has no per-user identity yet, so `reassign_action`
(which needs a real actor GUID) is never called — `assignee` stays a local
free-text field only until that's solved. Also not attempted: linking the
ToDo to the RFA's own Egeria Annotation element via `add_action_target` —
today's local RFAs are flattened from `activity_log` rows and don't
reliably carry a real Egeria annotation GUID to link against.

    direction reconciliation pass can retry it later.

    Real bug found and fixed during live verification (2026-08-16): the
    update path originally sent a `{"class": "ToDoProperties",
    "activityStatus": "WAITING", ...}` body straight to
    `MetadataExpert.update_metadata_element_properties()` (the fully
    generic metadata-element endpoint) — that shape was silently accepted
    (no HTTP error) and changed nothing; its real wire contract needs each
    property individually typed (`EnumTypePropertyValue`/
    `PrimitiveTypePropertyValue`) plus epoch-millis dates, none of which
    that first attempt supplied.

    Fixed by switching to `MyProfile.update_asset()` instead (per direct
    guidance — a `ToDo` is an `Asset` subtype, so the Asset-specific update
    endpoint applies) — confirmed live: it accepts the same plain,
    `typeName`-tagged properties shape `create_my_todo()` already uses
    (human-readable date strings included, no epoch-millis conversion
    needed), and does a real partial update — fields not included in the
    call (description, qualifiedName, dueTime when omitted) are left
    untouched, not wiped. Simpler and more correct than the generic
    endpoint's typed-property-value contract.
