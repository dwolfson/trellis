"""The kind of a blueprint, in its name (project owner, 2026-10-07; brief section 4).

A repository can be read as several different blueprints, and they are not interchangeable: a
deployment blueprint and a logical blueprint over the same repository are both correct and share
components (`docs/curation-lenses-design.md` section 1). So the KIND rides in the name of what RE
writes: "Egeria Deployment Blueprint", "Egeria Build Blueprint", "Egeria Logical Blueprint"; the
generic form is "<repository> <Kind> Blueprint".

Pure functions: nothing here reads or writes Egeria. `blueprint_kind_rows` is the selector at the top
of "what it's made of": one row per kind RE can offer, with its source and its state, said plainly
about the ones not yet drawn.
