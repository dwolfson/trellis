"""Documentation-location resolution — where does a project's documentation
actually live, and where is a specific artifact (architecture doc, changelog,
examples, ...) within it.

Why this module exists (design §5.5a/§5.5b, spike finding 68): a survey that
only reads a repo's own `docs/` directory finds architecture documentation in
2 of 12 measured cases. Four of five topologies measured (finding 68) keep
documentation in a **sibling repo** (`kubernetes/website`, `odpi/egeria-docs`,
`milvus-io/milvus-docs`, `prometheus/docs`) rather than in-tree. Answering
"is this documented" by checking one directory's mtime is worse than not
answering: `kubernetes/kubernetes/docs/` is 1412 days stale by that naive
metric, on one of the best-documented projects in existence, because the
real docs moved to `kubernetes/website` (pushed today) and `docs/` is a
**tombstone** — `.gitignore` and `OWNERS`, nothing else. A tombstone is a
*positive* curation signal (deliberate relocation), not absence, and must be
reported as such (§5.5a(c) point 3).

**No ranking, no score.** §5.5a(c) point 4 and §5.5b are explicit: this
module reports locations and dates as dated evidence, never a "documentation
health" number. A small stable library documenting lightly on purpose and a
project that deliberately archived stale docs both look different from "no
docs", but neither is worse than the other — that judgement is a human's
(or a later, separate classification pass's) to make, not this module's.

Two entry points:

- `resolve_doc_locations(owner_repo)` — every documentation location found
  for a project: in-repo doc directories (real or tombstone), the declared
  homepage, sibling documentation repos in the same org, and off-site
  architecture links pulled from the README.
- `find_artifact(owner_repo, kind)` — resolve one specific kind of artifact
  (`architecture`, `readme`, `examples`, `deployment`, `changelog`,
  `api-reference`) to a **location**, never a boolean. Exactly four
  outcomes — `in-repo` / `sibling-repo` / `doc-site` / `not-found` — and
  only the last is an absence. This is the fix for the Kubernetes case
  above: naive in-repo-only search returns "not found, stale 1412 days";
  the correct answer is "in `kubernetes/website`, pushed today".

Graceful absence, never an exception (rule from `code_markers._binary()`
and `detect.py`'s `_coupling_components`): no token, no network, and a
rate limit all degrade to a result carrying a clear note in `.notes`
rather than raising. Every network call in this module is individually
guarded so one failing signal (e.g. the README fetch) never takes down the
others (e.g. sibling-repo listing) — same posture as `_coupling_components`
treating a missing signal file as "a note, not an error".

Token handling mirrors `github/client.py`: `GITHUB_TOKEN` comes from
`get_config().github`, passed to PyGithub's `Github(...)` constructor —
never placed in argv, a URL, or a log line (PyGithub sends it as an
`Authorization` header internally).
