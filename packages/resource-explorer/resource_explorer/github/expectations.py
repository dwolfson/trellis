"""Role-derived expectation sets — what a mature project of this kind should
have, and **where each thing actually is**.

Design reference: `docs/architecture-recovery-design.md` §5.5b, subsection
"The expectation set — and reporting *where*, not *whether*". Third and last
piece of the classification work, composing the two that precede it:
`repo_role.classify_repo_role()` says what the repo is, and
`doc_locations.find_artifact()` says where a given artifact lives.

The maintainer's framing, which this implements literally:

  1. classify the kind of thing the project is,
  2. derive what a mature project of that kind should have, then look for it,
  3. the result is part of the classification, and tells you where to look
     for everything else.

**Three properties this module is designed around, each with a reason.**

*Locations, never booleans.* Every expected artifact resolves to `in-repo`,
`sibling-repo`, `doc-site` or `not-found`, and only the last is an absence.
Finding 68 is why: asked naively, "does Kubernetes document its architecture?"
answers *no* — `kubernetes/kubernetes/docs/` is a tombstone untouched for ~1400
days — when the truth is `kubernetes/website`, updated the same day.

*Absence cuts both ways, so role must be established first.* A missing
deployment artifact in an `application` is a maturity finding; the same absence
in a `library` **confirms** the classification. `trellis.md` records exactly
that case ("no Dockerfiles, no compose files ... it has no deployment
perspective at all"). The identical observation means opposite things depending
on the role, which is why `NOT_EXPECTED` is a first-class output here rather
than an empty set.

*No score, ever.* §5.5a(c) point 4 and §5.5b are explicit, and the reason is
not squeamishness: a checklist becomes a maturity score, and a maturity score
punishes deliberate choices. A small, stable library documents lightly on
purpose; a project may keep tutorials in-tree on purpose. So this module emits
lists of findings with evidence and dates. It deliberately exposes no count, no
percentage and no grade, and callers should resist computing one.
