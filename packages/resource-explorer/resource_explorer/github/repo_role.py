"""Repo-role classification — what does this repository *represent*
(library, application, tutorial, ...) before asking what its architecture
is (design §5.5b, "What the repo *is* — classification before analysis").

Why this module exists. Spike finding 58 ran architecture recovery against
`workshops`, OpenLineage's tutorial materials, and got 45 proposed
components — 44 of them manufactured from compose files that *demonstrate*
a deployment rather than declaring one. Finding 60 records the fix a human
applied by hand: reading the README, which said the repo's intent was a
tutorial, settled it in two seconds. That is exactly the classification
this module automates — **not a new idea, a generalisation of one already
proven** (§5.5b's framing).

**It is a gate, not a weighting.** Per the maintainer (§5.5b): "If we
classify a repo as being a tutorial there is no point trying to discover
an architecture." A `tutorial`/`samples`/`documentation` primary role means
architecture recovery does not run at all — not runs-and-scores-low. This
module only classifies; the caller (not built here — deferred, see the
task boundary below) is what wires the gate.

**Cardinality: multi-valued with one primary.** `egeria-workspaces` is
genuinely deployment *and* tutorial; `trellis` is application *and*
library. `RepoRoleClassification.roles` is a ranked list; `.primary` is
`roles[0]` and is what drives the expectation set and the gate. The
others are retained as evidence, not discarded — a monorepo playing two
roles is a fact about the repo, not classifier noise.

**No score. Ordering is fine, grading is not.** §5.5a(c) and §5.5b are
explicit: a checklist becomes a score, and a score punishes deliberate
choices (a small stable library documenting lightly on purpose does not
"lose points" against a heavily-documented one). Every function in this
module ranks or gates categorically — README-stated intent outranks
inference, a fixed precedence breaks ties among structurally-inferred
roles — never by summing points into a number.

**Vocabulary (7 values) — a placeholder for an Egeria valid value set,
deliberately not a Python enum.** §5.5b's "Vocabulary check against
Egeria" ran `DeployedImplementationType` / `ResourceUse` / `Category` /
`ProjectStatus` and confirmed none of them encode "what kind of body of
work is this" — the adjacent slot, `deployedImplementationType`, already
holds `"GitHub Repository"` (hosting technology; see
`surveyors/egeria_publisher.py:295`), and overloading it with role would
repeat the §4.1c "one field, two meanings" mistake. The design's
"Recommended shape" paragraph (§5.5b) calls for a new Egeria **valid
value set** — catalogable, queryable, extensible without a code change —
the same mechanism `ConfidenceLevel` already uses. That migration is a
separate Dr.Egeria/pyegeria task; **this module does not write to
Egeria** and these seven constants are the whole vocabulary until it
does. When that migration happens, these constants become the seed data
for the valid value set, not dead code to delete.

Graceful absence, never an exception — same posture as `doc_locations.py`:
no token, no network, and a rate limit all degrade to a result carrying a
note in `.notes`, never a raised exception. This module reuses
`doc_locations`'s client construction and repo-fetch helpers directly
rather than re-implementing them.

#     the reason ranking reports a fraction rather than a cut-off (finding 77).
