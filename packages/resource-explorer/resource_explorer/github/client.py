        Clone `repo` into `dest_dir` as a **treeless** (`--filter=blob:none`)
        checkout and return the clone root. History is complete unless
        `shallow_since` bounds it; file *contents* are fetched from the
        remote lazily, on demand, rather than up front.

        This exists for co-change coupling (design §5.7 gap 2): a zipball
        (see download_zipball above) has no `.git` at all, and a shallow
        clone (`--depth`) truncates exactly the history co-change needs —
        neither works. Treeless is the one clone mode that is both
        affordable and history-complete: a full non-treeless clone of a
        large repo is the single largest cost this feature could incur.

        `--no-checkout` on top of `--filter=blob:none` is not optional: a
        normal clone checks out HEAD's working tree, which under a treeless
        filter means fetching every blob in HEAD's tree from the promisor
        remote during clone — silently paying for the exact thing
        `--filter=blob:none` exists to avoid. Without a working tree, the
        yielded root has `.git` and full commit/tree/rename metadata but no
        checked-out files; that's the right shape for `git log --name-only`
        (walks commit/tree objects, never a blob) and wrong for anything
        that wants to read file contents. Only `cochange.py` consumes this
        provider today, and it only ever runs `git log --name-only` — so
        the pairing is sound. It is worth restating for whoever adds the
        next consumer: reading file contents out of this root will trigger
        a blob fetch per file touched and erode the whole point of
        treeless.

        Auth mirrors download_zipball(): the same `GITHUB_TOKEN`
        (`cfg.token`), via `GIT_CONFIG_*` env vars rather than embedding the
        token in the clone URL or passing it as a CLI arg — either of those
        would leave it readable in this process's argv (e.g. to `ps`) or in
        a `.git/config` file inside the tempdir. `http.extraHeader` is the
        same "Authorization: token …" shape download_zipball() sends as an
        HTTP header, just handed to git via its config-from-env mechanism
        instead of httpx/requests.

        Time-bound: `cfg.clone_timeout_seconds` (default 300s, same knob
        download_zipball() uses) via subprocess timeout — a hung clone must
