"""Catalogue scope for a database: what Curate decides gets catalogued.

Slice A of the catalogue-scope work (the designer's reply on catalogue scope,
page 18 of wireframes/CatalogueScope.dc.html). Everything up to
the commit button; NOTHING here writes to Egeria and nothing here compiles a
list for Egeria's cataloguer. That is slice B.

The one rule: the scope is a declared, signed, dated choice stored in RE. A
node (a schema or a table) is `catalogue`, `leave_out`, or absent, which is
undecided. Storage is two append-only registry tables
(`catalogue_scope_events`, `catalogue_scope_baselines`); the current choice of
a node is its newest event, and a cleared choice is itself an event so who
cleared it is never lost.

What may be PROPOSED (designer section 2, exactly): only a measured fact that
decides ALONE. Three rules, one function each, and nothing else may propose:

- `empty_schema`   a schema with 0 tables, measured (never "no access")  -> leave out
- `dormant`        0 writes in cumulative counters covering >= `DORMANCY_DAYS` -> leave out

(Slice A2, the designer's round-2 reply: the old two-survey `no_writes` rule and the
name-matching `data_lens_match` proposal are gone. A lens term found in table names is a
SUGGESTED RULE sentence, never a proposal; rules themselves are a later slice.)

PII data classes are a MARK, never a proposal. A staging-looking schema name
is a NOTE, never a proposal. No access is "not established", never a
proposal. A verdict never proposes (it gates; the commit's population rule is
slice B). `propose_for_node` is the only door a proposal goes through, and
`tests/test_catalogue_scope.py` fails on purpose if any of those four sneaks in.

Four observation states, no fifth: proposed, confirmed, overridden, and
"survey now disagrees". A person's own choice that no rule proposed is
`chosen`; no choice at all is `undecided`; a table following its schema is
`inherited`. Those three are not observation states, they are the choice
itself.
