"""The catalogue commit for a database, by schema-kind targets (slice B).

`BRIEF-CURATE-CATALOGUE-COMMIT-DATABASES.md`. Slice A (`catalogue_scope.py`)
keeps the scope: a declared, signed, dated choice per schema and table. This
module compiles that record into Egeria's lever every time it is pressed, and
shows what Egeria actually holds afterwards.

**The door is the schema-kind catalog target** (owner's decision, 2026-10-05).
One DeployedDatabaseSchema per chosen schema, created from the template and
attached to the JDBC cataloguer with no configuration lists. Never the database
element and never the server: a database-kind target catalogues every schema's
tables directly under the database whatever its lists say.

Three mechanisms run, in this order, and the manifest names all three:

1. RE publishes the server and database elements (description and version
   supplied, the server's own description, so no `~{...}~` placeholder remains),
   then Owner from Context. **RE writes no ZoneMembership unless the deployment
   configured `EXPLORER_PUBLISH_ZONES`** (the rehearsal of 2026-10-05 found that a
   zone written first locks the service identity, Egeria's survey engine and the
   cataloguer out of the database element, and RE cannot undo it). With the setting
   configured the zone is the LAST write, after the targets, the survey submission,
   the refresh and the owner, is read back, and a refusal is reported in Egeria's
   words and never retried. Without it the element's zones are Egeria's defaults,
   shown as a read-back fact: "zones: <list> · set by Egeria".
2. Egeria's cataloguer creates the schemas' tables and columns on its next
   refresh. RE attaches one schema-kind target per chosen schema (reading the
   targets first, never attaching twice).
3. Egeria's survey measures, limited to the chosen schemas by the request
   parameter `includeSchemaNames` (never the connection configuration, which
   the service ignores; a schema whose name contains a comma cannot be scoped).

**Every state word is derived from a persisted proof row.** The tree's per-node
state comes from `catalogue_commit_proofs` (what a read-back saw) and from the
`egeria_outbox` rows this commit queued (queued, failed), never from the branch
the code took (the status-words rule). `derive_commit_state` is the one
function that does it, so the route, the header marker and the tests cannot
disagree.

Leaving a schema out has two forms, chosen per schema from a relationships read
and said in the preview before the press: soft-delete when nothing hangs off
it, archive (the delete endpoint with deleteMethod ARCHIVE; the `/archive`
endpoint answers 500) when something does. A failed read is "couldn't check
what hangs off it", never nothing. Every delete RE performs is per element,
leaf first, `forLineage` true, never a cascade.
