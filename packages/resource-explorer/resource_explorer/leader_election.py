"""Postgres advisory-lock leader election for the worker role's loops.

The problem this closes (docs/process-model.md, Finding F2): none of the
three always-on loops — the scheduler (which per F1 also drains the
Egeria outbox and reconciles RFA actions inside its own tick), the
bootstrap monitor, and the Egeria resync scanner — took any lock. Their
``start_*`` functions are idempotent *within one process*, and nothing
at all stopped two RE processes sharing one Postgres registry from
running all three concurrently. ``run_reconciler.py``'s own docstring
calls a second process on another port "routine during development", so
the exposure was real rather than hypothetical: double-fired schedules,
duplicated RFA reconciliation, and two drains racing on outbox claims.

Mechanism
---------
``pg_try_advisory_lock(bigint)`` — **session**-scoped, not
transaction-scoped, so the lock is held for as long as the connection
that took it stays open, and Postgres releases it automatically if that
connection drops (a killed worker frees its locks without a janitor).
It never blocks: it returns false immediately if someone else holds the
key, which is exactly the "am I the leader, yes or no" question, and is
why the ``_try_`` variant is used rather than ``pg_advisory_lock``.

Each lock holds its **own dedicated connection** (``NullPool``, so
SQLAlchemy hands back a real connection rather than a pooled one that
could be recycled out from under the session). Three loops means three
connections held for the life of the process; that is the cost of
session-scoped locks and it is small against the registry's pool.

Keys
----
Derived, not hand-picked, so adding a loop cannot silently collide with
an existing key: ``blake2b(f"{KEY_NAMESPACE}:{name}", digest_size=8)``
read as a signed big-endian int64 (Postgres advisory keys are
``bigint``). The three current values are pinned by
``tests/test_leader_election.py`` so a namespace or name change is
visible as a test failure rather than as two processes quietly both
becoming leader across a rolling restart. Run
``python -m resource_explorer.leader_election`` to print them.

Not Postgres
------------
The registry is Postgres-only now (runtime-architecture-plan.md §3: the
SQLite fallback in ``registry.py`` is retired). If a code path still
constructs a SQLite registry, election degrades to a **no-op that grants
leadership**, with a warning — a single-process SQLite setup has no peer
to lose an election to, and crashing there would be a worse answer than
running the loops. No SQLite locking is implemented or intended.
