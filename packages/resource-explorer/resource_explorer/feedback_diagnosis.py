"""What an admin needs to diagnose a rated answer: its stored compile, the causes the manifest suggests, and the
analyses the item is charged to.

docs/feedback-closed-loop-design.md §2.3, §3.1 and §6 step 1. Three rules hold throughout:

* **Stored, never re-compiled.** Everything here reads the compile row persisted when the answer was given
  (`context_compiles`, with the text the model saw). A re-compile shows today's evidence, not the evidence behind
  the answer being judged.
* **A suggestion is never a diagnosis.** Each one is shown with the rule that produced it, and nothing here
  records anything: the admin confirms or changes it, and only their Save writes a cause.
* **Only four causes have a manifest signal.** `analysis_defect`, `wrong_evidence`, `reasoning` and
  `unclear_question` are a person's call, so nothing is suggested for them.

The charge set is wider than what was packed, because the analysis most often at fault is the one that is NOT in
the answer (the architect's read-back of 9c28a6bc): packed sections, gaps judged absent, dropped sections, and the
deferred sections the catalog names for this question. It is used to group the admin by-cause view; the project
owner decided on 2026-11-10 that diagnosis stays with admins (§8 Q2), so it grants nobody anything.
