"""The Postgres run queue — enqueue from anywhere, execute in the worker.

`docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md` §2, step 2b. Until this existed, a `web`
request that started a survey spawned a `threading.Thread` and returned. Three
consequences, all of them observed rather than theorised:

* The run lived in whichever uvicorn process happened to serve the request, so
  `--workers N` spread long-running work across processes by luck of routing.
* A `--no-embed-worker` web process — supposedly "HTTP only" — was still where
  every survey actually executed, which is the plan's own rule for the `web`
  role being violated by the `web` role.
* The only record of ownership was a pid buried in an `activity_log` row's
  `detail`, judged *after the fact* by `run_reconciler.py`. A claim taken
  before the work starts is the same question asked in time to be useful.

**What did not change: the frontend contract.** A route still creates its
`activity_log` row up front, still returns `{"status": "started",
"activity_id": ...}`, and the browser still polls `GET /api/activity/{id}` and
reads the run's result out of that entry's `detail`. The queue row carries that
activity id in `result_ref`; the worker writes the terminal activity status
through the very same `execute_and_record_*` functions the route's background
thread used to call. From the UI's point of view the only difference is which
process did the work.

**Claiming.** `registry.claim_next_run()` selects and marks in one transaction,
with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on Postgres so a second claimer skips a locked
row rather than blocking on it. See that method for the per-user fairness rule
and why the empty `requested_by` bucket is exempt from it — since 2026-09-04
that bucket holds only the worker's own service-account work, so the exemption
is narrow and the fairness rule finally applies to real people.

**Attribution.** A claimed row is executed inside `_run_as_requester`, which
publishes `requested_by` as the caller so anything the run writes to Egeria is
owned by the person who asked for it. The row deliberately carries no Egeria
token — see that function for why, and for what the resulting gap is.

**Heartbeating.** A run's heartbeat is written every
`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` by a small companion thread, not by the executing
thread itself — the executing thread is, by construction, inside a survey that
may not return for sixteen minutes, so it cannot also be the thing that proves
it is alive. The companion thread's own liveness is the process's liveness,
which is exactly what reconciliation tests.

**Reconciliation** stays in `run_reconciler.py` and stays pid-based. A missed
heartbeat makes a row a *candidate*; only a provably-dead owning process makes
it a failure. A worker paused by a slow Egeria call is late, not gone.

    or from a terminal all carry the same user id with no per-call-site
    threading — which is exactly why this was a function and not a literal.

    `""` now means one thing only: **the worker's own service-account work**,
