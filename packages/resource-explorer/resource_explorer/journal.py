"""The journal: why a resource matters, written to be read by someone else.

Everything else RE holds about a resource is written to be CORRECT — a
measurement, a verdict, a field with an author. A journal entry is written
to be READ: prose, dated, addressed to someone. Curation is not only getting
the record right; it is advocacy, and a curator who catalogues a resource
accurately and tells nobody has done half the job.

Three properties follow, and each is a relief:

* **Append-only.** An entry is a statement someone made on a date. Later
  events do not invalidate it — they get a later entry. So it sits outside
  the durable/perishable split entirely: no review flags, nothing to
  reconcile, never overwritten.
* **It has an audience, and the product already knows who.** Suggesting a
  resource is a routing question, and perspectives answer it — a note on a
  data-heavy repo is for Data Experts and Consumers, the same tags on every
  question row. So suggestion is "pick a perspective, or pick a person",
  not a share dialogue.
* **A suggestion arrives as a work-list entry, not a notification.** Work
  lists already exist, carry counts, and survive being ignored for a
  fortnight; a notification is a thing you dismiss. One list per audience —
  "Suggested to Data Expert" — the resource as a member, the entry as its
  rationale. The same promote mechanism the sub-resources and selections
  already use.

What this deliberately does not do: block cataloguing on an entry. Advocacy
written to satisfy a required field produces "useful library" on two
hundred assets. The empty state is visible instead — catalogued, never
written about — which a corpus view can count.

The author is stamped by the caller from the signed-in identity; this
module never takes one on trust from a payload.
