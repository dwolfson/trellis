"""Egeria Project context API — Part 5 of
docs/discovery-automate-project-context-plan.md, the "uber intent."

Always "Egeria Project" in code/UI — deliberately distinct from RE's own
`Project` class (registry.py, a registered repo/resource) which is an
unrelated concept that happens to share the word (see that plan's own
naming-collision note).

Deliberately generic across entity_type (repo/database/filesystem), same
pattern as context.py's Enrichment routes — nothing here is repo-specific.
