"""Prefect observability — flow-run status, grouping, and cancellation for
locally-dispatched (executes_at: prefect) survey steps.

Scope boundary, worth keeping visible rather than implying more than this
covers: this is about **locally-run** survey steps that Prefect executes.
`executes_at: egeria` steps are coordinated by Egeria itself — RE has no more
visibility into those than it did before this module existed, and nothing
here should be read as covering them. See docs/re-ea-consolidation-audit.md
and the Prefect entry in docs/Backlog.md.

Follows schedules.py's precedent: thin APIRouter, no auth, and — since this
depends on a Prefect server that may not be running — every endpoint degrades
gracefully (empty list / status flag) rather than raising, so a missing
server shows as "not reachable" in the UI, not a broken page.
