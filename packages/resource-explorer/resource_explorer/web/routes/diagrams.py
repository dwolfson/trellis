"""Server-side diagram rendering — proxies to the shared Kroki container so
the browser doesn't need to run mermaid.js (or any future Kroki-supported
diagram language) client-side. See config.py's KrokiConfig for why this has
to be a backend proxy rather than the frontend calling Kroki directly:
resource-explorer isn't on the egeria_network docker network, so it reaches
Kroki via its published host port, which the frontend has no business
knowing about — same reasoning as every other internal-infra call (Postgres,
Egeria) always going through a backend route, never straight from the
browser.

    no response-shape change on the caller's side.

    No fallback if Kroki is unreachable — this raises a clear 502 instead
    (see docs/kroki-diagram-rendering.md for why that's a deliberate choice,
    not an oversight: the alternative is re-vendoring mermaid.js client-side
    just for this failure path, undoing the bundle-size win of moving
    rendering server-side in the first place). The frontend already
    degrades gracefully around that error — one diagram panel shows an
    error message, the rest of the page is unaffected.
