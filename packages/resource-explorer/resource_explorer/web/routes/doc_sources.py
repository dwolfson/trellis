"""Documentation sources API — Enrichment stage, slice 1 ("Declare and
probe") of `docs/design-notes/BRIEF-DATABASE-DOCUMENTATION-SOURCES.md`.

A person declares a URL pointing at documentation for a database or
filesystem — a wiki page, a data dictionary, a runbook — RE probes it
read-only and reports one of `reachable`/`needs_sign_in`/`not_found`/
`blocked` (`doc_source_probe.py`, mirroring `credential_capability`'s
posture and vocabulary), and when the resource is published each source
becomes an `ExternalReference` on its Egeria asset (`doc_source_egeria.py`,
reusing `egeria_publisher.py`'s `_publish_homepage_reference` pattern).

Only `database`, `filesystem` and (E2) `repo` entity types are wired — the brief allows
scoping filesystem out for time ("prioritize database first... note
explicitly... if scoped out") but it turned out to need no extra code
beyond the entity resolver below, since `FileSystemEntity` carries the same
`egeria_url`/`egeria_server`/`egeria_user`/`egeria_password`/
`egeria_asset_guid`/`display_name` shape `DatabaseEntity` does — so both are
built together in this slice rather than filesystem being deferred.
Ingest/re-ingest actions (slice 2, `doc_source_ingestion`) are NOT wired
here; the frontend renders them as visibly disabled ("ingest — coming
soon") rather than omitting the affordance, so slice 2 has a known place to
attach rather than inventing UI from scratch.

    from persisted facts passed in — never from which code path produced
    them. Design session (2026-09-29, round 4, after the adoption-race fix)
    asked for exactly this shape: every earlier version of this decision
    trusted `ref_guid` alone as proof of "catalogued", which is also
    precisely what let a read-back-adopted reference (ref guid set, no link
    ever created — see `doc_source_egeria.publish_doc_source`'s adoption-race
    guard) render as fully catalogued when it was never actually linked to
    THIS asset.

    No side effects, no branching on "how we got here" — same `row`/
    `outbox_row` shape whether the row was declared locally, adopted by
    read-back, or is being re-derived on a plain `GET`. See
    `tests/test_doc_sources_routes.py::TestDeriveEgeriaStateTable` for the
    full input-combination table this is pinned against.

    - `catalogued` — BOTH `ref_guid` and `link_guid` are non-empty. This is
      the only state that means "this source has a real
      `ExternalReferenceLink` to THIS asset in Egeria", not merely "an
      `ExternalReference` element with this qualifiedName exists somewhere".
      Detail is the ref guid (the brief's "surfaced somewhere accessible" —
      the frontend puts it in a `title` attribute).
    - `local_only` — the resource itself isn't published yet. Same rule as
      before this fix (`egeria_linkage.describe_publish_status`), unchanged.
    - `publishing` — `outbox_row["status"]` is `pending`/`running`.
    - `publish_failed` — `outbox_row["status"]` is `failed` (still retrying)
      or `dead` (retries exhausted — worded the same way; a `dead` row is
      the rarer case, already reported to a human via the outbox's own
      `record_drain_outcome` → RFA path, and is not given a wording of its
      own). Detail is the row's own `last_error`, never a generic message.
    - `not_catalogued` — everything else: most notably `ref_guid` set,
      `link_guid` EMPTY, and no outbox row in flight — a reference exists
      but was never (yet) linked to this asset, whether from a read-back
      adoption, a crash between create and link, or a row stranded before
      this fix existed. Rendered honestly rather than the old code's
      `publishing` (a real find-absence-as-answer bug: nothing was pending,
      nothing was running, the row said so anyway). The self-heal that
      queues a fresh publish for this exact shape is the ORCHESTRATOR's job
      (`_compute_egeria_state`, below) — this function has no side effects

    """The one place that calls the pure `derive_doc_source_egeria_state`
    AND owns this feature's one side effect: self-healing.

    A row landing on `not_catalogued` while the resource IS published means
    something needs to be (re-)queued — the add/read-back path missed
    enqueueing a publish for it (a source declared before this fix landed, a
    narrow race between "declare" and "this resource's publish landing", or
    a read-back adoption that set a ref guid without a link), OR an existing
    outbox row for it already reached `done` with a claim that no longer
    holds (round 6, 2026-09-29 — see below). Either way `derive_doc_source_
    egeria_state` will keep reporting `not_catalogued` forever unless
    something acts on it here.

    **A `done` outbox row is only a valid reason to skip self-heal WHILE its
    proof still holds.** `derive_doc_source_egeria_state` already proves the
    negative for us: reaching `not_catalogued` at all means `ref_guid` and
    `link_guid` are not BOTH set (see its own docstring) — round 5's own
    "done means verified" rule (`egeria_outbox.py::_create_doc_source_
    publish`) means the only way an outbox row can be `done` AND this row
    still be `not_catalogued` is if that row predates round 5's guarantee
    (exactly the incident round 6 fixes: `doc_sources` row `4711d538`, ref
    guid `b9925119…` deleted from Egeria by an unrelated unpublish, an
    outbox row that reached `done` under the PRE-round-5 write-back rule
    without ever checking the guid still resolved). A `pending`/`running`
    row already reports `publishing` (not `not_catalogued`) and a `failed`/
    `dead` row already reports `publish_failed` — neither reaches this
    branch, so the only outbox statuses possible here are `None` (nothing
    ever queued) or `done` (queued, but its claim is stale).

    - `outbox_row is None` — nothing has ever tracked this element; queue a
      fresh `doc_source_publish` row (unchanged from round 4).
    - `outbox_row["status"] == "done"` — REOPEN that same row (round 6) via
      `registry.reopen_outbox_row` rather than inserting a second row for
      the same element: history stays one row per element, and the very
      next drain (this immediate attempt, or the normal 15-minute loop if
      it fails) runs round 5's verify-before-trust logic against it for
      real, which is what a pre-round-5 `done` row never got.

    LOGGED either way because this firing means something upstream should
    have queued (or correctly completed) it already — the self-heal
    recovering gracefully doesn't make it the expected steady state.
    Idempotent: once (re)queued, the next call finds the pending/running row
    and `derive_doc_source_egeria_state` reports `publishing` instead.

    # unreachable at that exact moment. The local row is already gone by the
    # time this runs, so there is nothing left to roll back if the Egeria
    # side fails or is slow — that's what the outbox's retry is for.
