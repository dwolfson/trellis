"""Investigations — the framing step ahead of Scouting.

`docs/investigation-framing-design.md` §1: an Investigation is one body of work,
"the thing the new tab creates and the context everything else runs inside."

Deliberately NOT a ninth intent. CLAUDE.md rule 17 fixes the eight canonical
intent labels, and this is not another kind of work done *to* a resource — it is
the frame the other eight run inside. It therefore sits at header level with
Activity and Admin, not in `#intent-nav`.

Local-first: an investigation exists with a nullable `egeria_project_guid`, so
all three of §1's starting modes (bind an existing Egeria Project, create a new
one, or stay purely local) produce ONE local row. Promotion is a fill-in, not a
migration.
