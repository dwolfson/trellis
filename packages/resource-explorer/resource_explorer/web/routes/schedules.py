    Dan, 2026-09-01: "With schedules and Surveys in Automate, seems like there
    should be a run now option?" There was not. Schedules had GET/POST/DELETE
    and `scheduler._run_due()` fires on a timer with no way to trigger one — so
    a schedule could only be WAITED for, which also made it impossible to
    confirm a schedule worked without watching for the slot to come round.

    Deliberately reuses `scheduler._execute`, the same dispatch the timer uses.
    A second code path would let "run now" and "ran on schedule" diverge, and
    the whole value of this is confirming what the SCHEDULE will do.

    Runs SYNCHRONOUSLY, in a worker thread, and returns the outcome. Not
    fire-and-forget: the point is to see the result. Note that some analyses are
    genuinely slow — repo_secret_scan measured 277s on a large repository — so
    a caller should expect this to block for as long as the analysis takes,
    which is the honest behaviour rather than a success returned before the work
    is done.

    Does NOT advance `next_run`. This is an out-of-band run, and moving the
    schedule because someone tested it would silently skip the next real slot —
    a side effect nobody asked for, and one that would be invisible until an
    expected run did not happen.
