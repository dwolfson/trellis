"""Compile a context for a question — the packer's HTTP surface.

NOT to be confused with routes/context.py, which is the Resource context API
(human-provided metadata and RFA generation, backing the Enrichment intent).
Different concern, and the similar names are a hazard: this file exists under
this name because `context.py` was already taken.

Returns the manifest and the derivation alongside the text, deliberately. A
caller that only gets text cannot say why a section is there, what was dropped,
or what is missing — and those are the three things a person actually asks.
