    """Declare, per analysis, whether a series is kept for it.

    THE ANALYSIS KNOWS. `REPO_ANALYSIS_RESULTS_MAP` registers a trend reader,
    or registers `None` deliberately for a current-state classification whose
    history would be a flat, near-meaningless line. That is a property of the
    analysis, so it belongs in the analysis's descriptor — and then a client
    never has to ask a trend endpoint a question whose answer is "no", and
    never has to render an error to say "correctly, there is nothing".

    Same shape as putting the tier on a survey row instead of warning that the
    stage filter failed: the fact moves to where it is known, and the failure
    it used to produce stops existing.

    Three states, not two — `series`, `first measurement`, and `not tracked` —
    and only the first two involve a request at all.
