Curate is about making a resource easier to find and more trustworthy to

resource itself (environment, ownership, sensitivity, ...).

Digital-product evaluation, sample-dataset creation, and quality-issue

design questions (data model, workflow) that haven't been scoped, not an

#: which is fail-closed by design — its docstring says it exists "only to gate
#: the feedback-triage admin endpoints", written to invert an Egeria Workspaces
#: bug where the equivalent check failed OPEN.
#:
#: **This route has no such gate**, and on 2026-09-01 it was widened to serve the
#: page-level store so the Admin pane would stop showing an empty list. That fix
#: was right and its scope was not: it routed data the gated endpoint protects
#: through an ungated one. Nothing was exposed in practice — no row carries an
#: email today — but the store has `wants_response` and `consent_to_contact`
#: columns, so emails are expected, and the next one would have been served to
#: anyone who could reach the port.
#:
#: Stripping is the INTERIM fix, agreed with Dan: it closes the exposure now
#: without emptying the pane, which gating would do until the frontend sends
#: `X-Admin-Token`. Gating this route properly is the real fix and is still
#: outstanding — when it lands, this stripping becomes redundant rather than
#: wrong, and the gated route can serve the full row.
#:
#: `message`, `rating`, `category`, `page`, `triage_status` and `created_at`
#: stay: they are the feedback itself, which is the point of the pane.

        module's `add_feedback` below) — per-resource, written from a
        resource's Curate tab.
      * `feedback` (`resource_explorer/feedback_store.py`) — the page-level
        widget reachable from anywhere in the app.

    A page-level submission and a per-resource one look, from the person who
    wrote it, exactly the same: feedback that was left and never showed up
    here. It was never dropped — the pane just never read the store it landed
    in. Diagnosed 2026-08-31 (Dan: "I added feedback on a page and it never
    makes it to the feedback pane of Admin").

    This combines both into one list rather than merging them: the two tables
    have genuinely different shapes (session/page/consent fields on one side,
    entity_type/slug on the other), and a real merge is a separate, deliberate
    task (see docs/Backlog.md) — not something to fold in as a side effect of

    two stay distinguishable until that task exists, and `source` is itself a
    filter for the same reason `entity_type`/`category` are.

    Declared before the /{entity_type}/{slug} route below only for readability;
    they cannot collide, since that one needs two path segments.

    Returns per-source counts (not a combined total, which would hide a store

# (a clustering.py proposal, not yet a real Egeria element) is what a
# curator accepts or rejects. Reuses architecture_component_verdicts (see
# the plan's Decision 3) rather than a parallel table — verdict_target
# distinguishes the two, and scope_locator is repurposed to hold
# f"{perspective}::{cluster_name}" since a blueprint has none of its own.
#
# Wires are deliberately NOT enqueued here (project-owner decision,
# 2026-09-03, after Phase A.5's live measurement confirmed
# SolutionLinkingWire duplicates on retry) — a materialized blueprint
# attaches its member components and child blueprints but renders without
# its wire diagram until that's built as its own follow-up.
