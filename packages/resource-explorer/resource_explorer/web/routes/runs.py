"""The run queue's own read surface.

Deliberately small, and deliberately NOT the surface the UI polls. The frontend
still polls `GET /api/activity/{activity_id}` for a run's *outcome* — that
contract predates the queue and did not change with it. These endpoints answer
a different question: what is queued, who claimed it, and is anything draining
the queue at all.

That distinction matters most in the state the queue newly makes possible. A
`web --no-embed-worker` process with no `resource-explorer worker` running
accepts every enqueue and executes none of them; the activity entry sits at
"running" and looks exactly like a slow survey. `GET /api/runs?state=queued`
is how that reads as "nothing is draining the queue" instead.
