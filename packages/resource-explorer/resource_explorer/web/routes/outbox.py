"""Publish Queue API — the detailed record behind an activity-log summary.

The activity log is an audit trail: one line per operation, saying *that* a
publish was incomplete. This is the log proper — which elements, their
qualifiedNames, how many attempts each took, and what Egeria actually said.
Admin → Publish Queue reads it, and the activity entry links here.

Kept separate from `activity.py` deliberately. Folding per-element detail into
activity entries would make every incomplete publish write a wall of text into
a surface designed to be skimmed one line at a time — and the detail belongs to
the rows, which outlive the entry and change as retries happen.
