# confusing"). This is about one ANSWER ("the answer to that question is
# wrong"), and the two must not be one control: product feedback goes to
# whoever builds the UI, a disputed answer goes to whoever wrote the
# analysis, and folding them together is how a real disagreement about a
# measurement ends up in a triage queue for button placement.
#
# A disagreement lands in the gaps collection (gaps.py) marked `ours` —
# destinations.py's rule 1: a finding about the analysis is never charged to
# the repository. Agreement and "partly right" land in the feedback store,
# because they are real signal about the answer and there is nowhere else
# that keeps them; they are deliberately NOT gaps, since nothing is owed.

#: What a person can say about one answer. `disagree` is the only verdict
#: that produces a gap — see the module note above.
