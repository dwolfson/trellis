/* Chat — the "Ask" rail and the answer pane it opens.
 *
 * Moved out of app.js (PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md item 9 — "Chat, under-utilised").
 * Chrome-level, like worklist.js and rfa.js: chat is not one of the eight
 * stages, it sits beside whichever one is active, scoped to the selected
 * resource. Unlike rfa.js it DOES import state/esc/$/etc. back from app.js —
 * the same choice stages/understanding.js already made (see that file's own
 * header comment) — because a turn's rendering is inseparable from the
 * pane/rail chrome app.js owns, and duplicating that chrome here would be
 * the two-copies bug this project keeps finding in its own docs.
 *
 * ASSESSMENT-CHAT.md's finding: almost nothing here was unbuilt. Session
 * continuity, `sourceLine()`, the compile id, the vote hash, Plotly charts
 * and server-rendered Mermaid diagrams all worked already — squeezed into a
 * 290px rail. SPEC-THE-STAGE-PAGE.md ruled that shape wrong for analyses
 * ("one place for the fact, the pane under the answer; the rail keeps
 * provenance only") and chat was "the last surface still doing the thing
 * that ruling fixed." This file applies the same rule here:
 *
 *   - the rail is the turn list, the ask box, and provenance — question,
 *     source line, vote, copy-as-evidence, "open the compile";
 *   - the PANE is where an answer is actually read: prose, chart, diagram or
 *     table alike, at full width, via `promoteToPane()` (still in app.js —
 *     shared with the Questions-checklist row-promotion path, so a chat
 *     chart and a fact's chart cannot drift into two renderers).
 *
 * Three follow-ups from ASSESSMENT-CHAT.md §3, in priority order:
 *   (a) open the compile — `turn.compiled` (the full {text, manifest,
 *       derivation}, not just the id) is now kept on the turn and openable
 *       into the rail's evidence slot via `openCompile()`.
 *   (b) use the stream — `askStream()` (re-api.js) drives `submitAsk()`,
 *       falling back to the blocking `ask()` only if the stream itself
 *       fails before any text arrived.
 *   (c) join the vote to the gaps loop — `vote()` now ALSO calls
 *       `submitAnswerFeedback()` (the same `/api/feedback/answer` endpoint
 *       item 8's Questions-checklist bar already posts to), so a chat "not
 *       helpful" lands as a `disagree` verdict and raises a gap the same way
 *       a disputed checklist answer does. Only when the turn has a resource
 *       in scope — see `vote()`'s own comment for why an unscoped turn
 *       cannot join this collection, which is a real boundary, not an
 *       oversight.
