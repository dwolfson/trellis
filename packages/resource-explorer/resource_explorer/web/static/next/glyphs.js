/* The one glyph table — Resource Explorer's `/next` UI.
 *
 * REPLY-DESIGNER-ROUND2-DATABASE-SCREENS.md §1: before this module, three
 * places each declared their own glyph-to-meaning mapping and disagreed with
 * each other about what a glyph meant --
 *
 *   `GLYPH`      (app.js, Questions rows)          -- ◐ meant "ran, not at
 *                                                      this level"; ○ meant
 *                                                      two different things
 *   `CELL`       (worklist.js, the comparison grid) -- ◐ meant "partial";
 *                                                      ○'s two meanings were
 *                                                      told apart by colour
 *                                                      alone, which breaks
 *                                                      the "colour is never
 *                                                      the only channel" rule
 *   `factGlyph`  (app.js, members rail / run history) -- a third, smaller
 *                                                      table
 *
 * This module is the single source. `GLYPH`, `CELL` and `factGlyph` are now
 * thin views over `STATES` below (see app.js and worklist.js) rather than
 * independent declarations -- there is exactly one glyph-to-meaning mapping
 * in the codebase, and it lives here.
 *
 * SHAPE: each entry is keyed by STATE -- a specific, named condition such as
 * "answered" or "no-surveyor" -- never by glyph. Several states legitimately
 * share a glyph (that's the "family" column in the reply's table): the glyph
 * names the family, meaning what a reader can do with this at a glance, and
 * `word` names the exact state for `title`/`aria-label`. Nothing is merged
 * in the data or on screen this way -- only the glyphs are grouped, and per
 * the reply, colour is still never the only channel carrying a state's
 * meaning (see the `tone` values, which match the STATE_TONE roles app.js
 * already used before this module existed).
 *
 * Only the states actually read by a caller today are included, plus the
 * handful named in the reply's own table (marked RESERVED below) that G2
 * (contents board) and G3 (schema-inventory tree) are blocked on this
 * module to define -- the dispatch explicitly holds both until this lands,
 * "since they both reference the exact glyph set you're defining here."
 *
 * A NOTE ON ⚠: per the reply, this glyph now means ONLY "needs a person".
 * A disagreement between two measurements uses `≠`; a failure uses `✕`.
 * Before this change, app.js's `openRunsList` (run-history step rows) used
 * ⚠ for "this step's status was not ok", which is an error, not something
 * that needs a person -- fixed alongside this table, see app.js.
 *
 * THIS MODULE HAS NO IMPORTS, deliberately -- every one of its several
 * consumers (app.js, worklist.js, stages/curate.js, and whichever of G2/G3's
 * new surfaces come next) can import it with no risk of a cycle.
 */

/**
 * A pinned symbol-font stack for the four glyphs the reply names as an
 * off-Mac risk: ◐ ◌ ∅ ◔ are not reliably present in default system fonts
 * outside macOS (the reply: "In a headless Linux browser, ◐ came out as a
 * sliver until I set the font explicitly"). The whole vocabulary is pinned
 * to the same stack rather than only those four, so a reader never sees one
 * glyph rendered in the body serif and its neighbour in a fallback symbol
 * font -- a state vocabulary should look like one alphabet.
 *
 * Chosen over inline SVG (the reply's other option): these are plain BMP
 * symbols (U+2600-27BF, U+25A0-25FF) that a real symbol font renders
 * correctly once one is reachable, and the states these glyphs annotate
 * already carry their word in `title`/`aria-label` (see `glyphSpan` below),
 * so a tofu box is a legibility issue, not a meaning-loss issue, if every
 * font in the stack is somehow absent. Noto Sans Symbols 2 is the broadest
 * coverage available as a web-safe reference (not vendored -- this stack is
 * pure CSS `font-family` fallback, resolved against whatever the host has
 * installed, same as the rest of `/next`'s type system).
 *
 * Wired into Tailwind as the `font-glyph` utility -- see
 * frontend-build/tailwind-next.config.js's `fontFamily.glyph` -- rather than
 * hand-authored here, so it goes through the same generated-CSS pipeline as
 * every other font role in this UI (`font-body`, `font-heading`, `font-mono`).
 * This constant exists for the one call site (`glyphSpan`, `legendSpan`)
 * that needs the class name as a string, and as documentation for why that
 * class exists.
