/* The four observation row states (ENRICHMENT-E3, BRIEF-ENRICHMENT-E3-
 * OBSERVATION-STATES.md). One PURE function over persisted rows -- no DOM,
 * no state, no imports -- so it is table-tested over every combination and
 * a status word on screen can only come from rows that prove it.
 *
 * An OBSERVATION is a fact a survey can measure and a person can also
 * supply (licence). A JUDGEMENT (sensitivity, owner, ...) is never proposed
 * from a survey: this function is only ever asked about observations that
 * have a proposing analysis, and the caller passes `measurement: null` for
 * every kind the analysis does not apply to.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   field        the person's persisted row, or null/{} if none:
 *                  { value, source, set_at, measured_value, measured_at }
 *                `measured_value`/`measured_at` are what the SERVER stamped
 *                from its own fact layer when the person wrote the row.
 *   measurement  what the survey measures NOW: { value, at } or null.
 *
 * Comparison is on the FACT, not its spelling: values are compared after
 * trimming, collapsing runs of whitespace, and lower-casing (`sameFact`), so
 * "mit", " MIT " and "MIT" are one licence and never a disagreement. Nothing
 * smarter is attempted (no licence-name aliasing): "Apache-2.0" and "Apache
 * License 2.0" differ.
 *
 * Output: { state, measured, stored }
 *   state     'none' | 'proposed' | 'confirmed' | 'overridden' | 'disagrees'
 *   measured  the current measurement's value ('' when none)
 *   stored    the measured value the person's row was made against ('')
 *
 * The disagreement rule compares the LATEST measurement against the STORED
 * measured value, never against the person's own value: a person who
 * overrode "MIT" with "Apache-2.0" must not be flagged when the survey says
 * "MIT" again. Only a measurement that differs from what was known when the
 * person chose raises `disagrees`, and only a person choosing again (which
 * re-stamps the stored measurement) clears it.
