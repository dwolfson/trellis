/* Resource Explorer — /next
 *
 * An experimental parallel UI. Skin 1c ("dark chrome, paper content") and one
 * redesigned screen: the Questions checklist, changed from reporting HOW a
 * question would be answered to reporting WHAT THE ANSWER IS, with its
 * caveat, its provenance and its state, per row.
 *
 * SCOPE, deliberately: the frame plus ONE real pane. That pane is Questions,
 * for a repo, live against the API — parameterised by stage rather than
 * duplicated per stage, because the endpoint already takes a `phase` and
 * because the six row states this screen argues for only ALL occur once you
 * leave Scouting. Every other sub-tab renders an honest "not built in /next"
 * rather than a half-working version: a half-built version of everything
 * proves nothing and takes ten times as long.
 *
 * THE ONE BEHAVIOUR THIS SCREEN EXISTS FOR: distinguishing "ran and found
 * nothing" from "never ran" from "cannot be answered here". The backend
 * already carries that distinction — `surveyors/result_status.py`'s states,
 * surfaced through `facts.py`'s Envelope — and this file must not collapse
 * it. A confident wrong answer is worse than no answer.

/** Three classes of nav item — RULING-NAV-GROUPING.md, answering a peer

 *  intents, in their canonical order, plus Investigation as the frame"
 *  comment, which is wrong in its count: there are six ORDERED intents
 *  ("the run"), not eight, plus two cross-cutting, plus the frame.
 *
 *  `class` is declared HERE and nowhere else — `renderIntentNav()` derives
 *  grouping, numbering and separator style (chevron for `run`, middot
 *  everywhere else) from this field rather than hardcoding a second list of
 *  which ids go where. The ruling is explicit that regrouping in the
 *  renderer while this array still called them "eight ordered intents"
 *  would be the same class of bug as `unbuilt` (DEFECT-UNBUILT-STAGES-RENDER-AS-BUILT.md — read in
 *  three places, set in none) and #130's
 *  dashed-styling-independent-of-its-flag bug: declare the fact once,
 *  derive appearance from it.
 *
 *  - `frame`        — Investigation (and, external to this array, Work
 *                      lists): why this body of work exists, and which
 *                      cohort you are working. Not a stage.
 *  - `run`           — Scouting, Discovery, Assessment, Analysis,
 *                      Enrichment, Curate: six ordered intents; sequence is
 *                      real, so they are numbered 1-6 and chevron-joined.
 *  - `cross-cutting` — Understanding, Automate: order does not apply.
 *                      Decision (project owner, 2026-09-18): Understanding
 *                      can be used at any time and will become a
 *                      user-configured dashboard — a surface the user
 *                      configures, not an operation on a corpus — so it is
 *                      not a milder or later stage of the run.

 * Three transforms, each measured against the live Kroki on 6002 rather than

 * `400 Internal Server Error` with no other diagnostic:
 *
 *  1. NO `%%` LINES AT ALL. This Kroki rejects any line beginning `%%` —
 *     a plain comment and an `%%{init: …}%%` directive alike, on a two-node
 *     diagram. That is why theming moved out of an init directive and into
 *     `themeSvgElement()` below; it is not a preference.
 *  2. `%` IS ESCAPED to `&percnt;`. A literal percent anywhere in a node
 *     label fails the whole render, and `architecture_diagram` writes
 *     confidence as `40% ⚠` into every label, so this alone made it
 *     unrenderable. `&percnt;` and NOT `&#37;`: both are accepted (200), but
 *     the numeric one comes back rendered as `40&%` — measured by reading
 *     the text nodes of the returned SVG, which is the only way to tell the
 *     two apart, since both "work" by status code.
 *  3. `class` ASSIGNMENTS ARE CAPPED at 20 nodes total. 20 renders, 21 does
 *     not, deterministically, whether on one line or split across several.
 *     Excess assignments are dropped rather than the diagram, and the caller
 *     says how many — losing the dashed "pending" styling on some nodes
 *     beats losing the diagram.
 *
 * THE REAL FIX IS IN THE GENERATOR, which should not emit source its own
 * renderer refuses. Worth noting the fact value carries
 * `exceeds_renderer_limit: false` for a diagram that no renderer here will
 * take — a guard that reports the opposite of what is true.

/** Narrows the schema tree by name across all three levels.
 *
 * Found live, `laz_local_adventureworks`, 2026-09-27 (Dan's Slice 22 gate):
 * the previous version matched every `[data-tree-node]` independently
 * against `data-tree-text`, which used to hold a table/schema's own name
 * PLUS every descendant's name concatenated together (so "does this node
 * match" really meant "does this node OR anything under it match"). That
 * made a TABLE look matched (its concatenated text contained the query),
 * but its COLUMN rows -- each carrying only their own name -- did not, so
 * they were independently hidden even though the table's own `<details>`
 * was open: filtering on "salesorderheader" opened the table and showed
 * nothing underneath it.
 *
 * `data-tree-text` is now always a node's OWN name only (schemaTreeHtml/
 * tableHtml's own comments). This recursion is what decides descendant
 * matching, per the rule the gate asked for:
 *   - a node whose OWN name matches shows EVERY descendant (unconditionally
 *     visible, but still collapsed unless individually opened) -- a
 *     matched table therefore reveals all its columns, and a matched
 *     schema reveals all its tables collapsed;
 *   - a node whose own name does not match, but some descendant's does,
 *     stays visible and its own `<details>` opens (so the path down to the
 *     match is reachable), while sibling branches that contain no match
 *     are hidden entirely;
 *   - a node with no match anywhere under it is hidden.
 *
 * Clearing the filter leaves every node exactly as it was (no
 * saved-collapse-state clobbering, unlike the sidebar's persistent one —
 * this tree has no cross-session collapse preference to protect). */

/* ── The third door: the things a count counted ──────────────────────────

 * customer data? — is chat. The one in the middle, and the most common:
 * WHICH 68? Which 18 advisories, which 90 files, which three sub-resources
 * were not worthy? Nothing opened that. The popup looked like the door and
 * opened the number's history instead, so a reader learned that 18 had been
 * 18 for a fortnight.
 *
 * Members render in the right rail, which on Analysis held an empty ask box
 * and eighteen hundred pixels of nothing. Click a count, the rail lists the
 * members; the centre column keeps its place. No modal, no navigation.
 *
 * Members nest — file → symbol today; endpoint → operation → schema when
 * those are measured — and PURPOSE decides how much of the tree you see:
 * intent to use wants the public surface, intent to maintain wants that
 * plus the internal structure. One tree, two default expansions, because
 * maintain is a superset. Only symbols carry a public/internal marker, and
 * that marker is inferred from naming — the rail says so.
 *
 * This is also where two disagreeing counts get settled: "open either to
 * see what each counted" was already the instruction on the disagreement
 * block, and until now it could not be followed.

/* ── Promotion: the selection becomes a thing someone acts on ────────────
 *
 * A member list is the first place in the product where a person looks at
 * THINGS rather than NUMBERS, and things are what you act on. "18" is not a
 * work item; "three of these have no fix" is.
 *
 * The filters ARE the selection. "Everything matching the thing I noticed"
 * should not need a click per row: a facet — a severity, a package — selects
 * its members in one. Hand-picking stays. Facets come from the fields the
 * annotation already stores; nothing is invented, which is also why "no
 * fix" is not one here — cve_scan does not record fix availability, and a
 * facet the data cannot back would select nothing and look broken.
 *
 * Three acts, and they are different: add to <investigation> (this belongs
 * in my investigation's scope; W1-A, it used to mint a one-resource work
 * list), raise RFA (someone must), note in journal (worth knowing — no
 * obligation, so the likeliest used). One provenance line, composed on the
 * server, travels with all three. The selection is a SNAPSHOT of names,
 * never a query: a work item that changes what it refers to when the scan
 * re-runs is unusable.
 *
 * No "ignore" / "accept risk" here. That is a disposition on the finding — a
 * judgement with an author and a date — and belongs to the perishable-field
 * machinery, not a toolbar.

 * By-analysis, rebuilt (BRIEF-BY-ANALYSIS-PANEL-USABILITY.md +
 * REPLY-DESIGNER-ROUND2-DATABASE-SCREENS.md §2, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * Two problems this rebuild exists for, both live-confirmed by the project
 * owner: (1) the pane rendered nothing but "Reading the dashboards…" for up
 * to 109s -- the ORIGINAL comment above the old single `getSurveyDashboards`
 * call named this cost and did nothing about it; (2) the Relationship
 * Graph card showed only numbers, never the graph `factGraphviz` already
 * knows how to render (the Questions-tab Evidence rail's own path).
 *
 * THE FIX FOR (1) IS NOT "make the reader faster" -- `build_survey_results`'s
 * own results/headline readers are genuinely expensive (db_derived-backed);
 * this pane stops BLOCKING ON THEM AS ONE BATCH instead:
 *
 *   - The contents board (glyph + headline + run time per board) paints from
 *     `state.analyses` -- already fetched at boot (`start()`'s
 *     `listAnalyses(...)` call) -- with NO network call at all when the
 *     current entity type is database/filesystem (board id === analysis_id
 *     there, so state.analyses IS the board list). repo's dashboards group
 *     several analyses under one id state.analyses doesn't carry, so repo
 *     falls back to the new cheap `listSurveyResultBoards`/`/survey-results/
 *     boards` endpoint (catalog metadata only, no results/headline reader
 *     -- see `workflows.analysis.list_survey_result_boards`'s docstring).
 *     Either way this is visible before ANY board's own data has been
 *     fetched.
 *   - Each board's real data is then fetched ONE AT A TIME, in parallel,
 *     via `getSurveyDashboards(..., { boardId })` (the new `board_id` query
 *     param `build_survey_results` now takes) -- not the old single call
 *     that read every board in one sweep. A card fills in as its own read
 *     lands; a slow board no longer holds up a fast one.
 *   - `dashToken`'s existing stale-read-cancellation pattern still applies
 *     (`live()` below), scoped to the whole pane load exactly as before.
 */

 *  theoretical): switching stages quickly left several `db_derived`-backed

 *  pool busy), which starved even the cheap boards-catalog call for the new

 *  that fix's effectiveness -- it applies whether a board's summary is
 *  missing/stale and the fallback recompute is fast or still slow, so the
 *  pane never hangs indefinitely on one card. The underlying fetch is not
 *  cancelled (no AbortController here -- the same reasoning `live()`
 *  already applies to an abandoned stage's in-flight reads: the request

 * dozen questions the task needs at the top and leaves the rest below,
 * deprioritised rather than gone. Perspective then filters, as built.
