/* Curate — review and commit.
 *
 * Moved out of app.js (PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md, Part 2 §1): app.js keeps
 * routing, shared state and chrome; each stage owns its own pane's
 * rendering logic. `renderCurate` is the only export app.js's generic
 * Questions-checklist engine calls directly, when `state.stage === 'curate'`
 * (see `loadPane()`'s big shared function in app.js); everything else in
 * this file — the component-tree/branch/leaf review, the catalogue-depth
 * offer, the verdict recorder — is reached only from within `renderCurate`
 * itself or from other functions in this module, so it stays unexported.

/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * Curate — review and commit
 *
 * One decision, one screen, one commit — and the commit has consequences in
 * two directions, so the screen's whole job is to show both before the
 * press. Three columns answer one question, "what should the catalogue know
 * about this?": what it IS, what it HOLDS, what it is MADE OF. Then how it
 * relates, then the manifest of what gets written. Almost everything on it
 * was decided earlier; this is where it is seen assembled.
 *
 * Rules held (Enrichment and Curate Wireframes; Repo Handoff item 6):
 * - Candidates with evidence, never auto-applied: every row names its
 *   analysis, its state, and opens its members. "Infrastructure Asset? 15
 *   Dockerfiles", with the question mark.
 * - Testimony is copied, measurements are linked, unresolved things travel.
 * - Only worthy things get curated: the population is `tracking` or `using`,
 *   and the pane says so rather than hiding the resource or the button.
 * - The commit is asynchronous and can fail elsewhere: the record shows each
 *   step as it lands, and a failed step is a failed step, not a lost act.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

 *
 * DepthOffer's three rules (FUNNEL-COST-RULINGS §3), applied to promoting
 * accepted architecture-recovery verdicts into real Egeria components
 * instead of running never-run analyses (owner's ruling, 2026-09-15, on
 * REPLY-CATALOGUE-IN-LAYERS.md §3):
 *
 *   not a nag   — offered once per catalogue record, in the pane, never a
 *                 modal (the backend refuses a second write on the same
 *                 record; already_decided is the UI's own courtesy check).
 *   not a gate  — layer 1 is already committed by the time this appears;
 *                 nothing here waits on an answer.
 *   not a scold — "N components recovered, M not catalogued" is a fact
 *                 about the record. No imperative sentence; the reader
 *                 decides whether it matters.
 *
 * Unlike DepthOffer, "accepted" here has no per-item choice to make: the
 * accept/reject decision already happens branch by branch in the component
 * tree (recordVerdicts). So the offer's one action is a link that opens the
 * tree, not a queue-in-background button — "choose which" would be asking
 * the reader to redo a decision the tree already offers properly.

 * the components are keyed by -- kafka's 642 become 71 -- and the decision
 * is made at the branch: a branch verdict inherits, a component's own

 * routes; it never hides: the ⚠ count rides on the branch. Grouping nodes
 * stay marked with the classic UI's words. Ports are two words on the row
 * where they exist, nothing where they do not, and one sentence at the
 * foot when a repository declares none, saying what it looked in. Bulk
 * accept goes through the shared preview dialog (rule 4): nothing runs
