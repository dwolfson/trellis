/* Enrichment — testimony, not paperwork.

 * Moved out of app.js (PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md, Part 2 §1): app.js keeps
 * routing, shared state and chrome; each stage owns its own pane's
 * rendering logic. `renderEnrichment` is called from app.js's generic
 * Questions-checklist engine when `state.stage === 'enrichment'` (see
 * `loadPane()`'s big shared function in app.js) — that engine itself stays
 * in app.js because it is shared machinery every built stage uses, not
 * Enrichment's alone. `renderEnrichmentEvidence` is exported too, though
 * only ever called from within `renderEnrichment` in this same module; it
 * stayed exported to mirror how app.js named it and in case a future
 * change needs to trigger the evidence rail from outside this file.

/* ── Enrichment: testimony, not paperwork ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two halves, not one list of eight fields with one Save. The line between
 * them is not arbitrary: a field is a JUDGEMENT if a person's opinion is the
 * value — sensitivity, criticality, intended use, actual use, owner — and an
 * OBSERVATION if a person is supplying a fact about the world — license,
 * environment, retention. Opinions need an author, a date and a review
 * state. Observations need a source.
 *
 * Judgements come first and get the room: they are the part only a person
 * can supply. Every field saves alone — someone who knows the owner and not
 * the sensitivity can say so and leave. The author and date sit on every
 * judgement without hovering, because testimony without an author is not
 * testimony, and because that is what makes review meaningful later.
 *
 * Perishability, which needs no per-field configuration: a judgement carries
 * the measurements that were on screen when it was made. When one of those
 * moves, the judgement is not invalidated — it gets a flag that says what
 * moved. "⚠ review — evidence moved: cve_scan" is a specific, answerable
 * prompt, not a staleness timer.
 *
 * Evidence sits in the rail as MATERIAL, never as proposals. No "apply
 * suggestion". The one exception is a fact a survey already established —
 * the license — which is offered to confirm, with its source, into the
 * observations half.
 *
 * Nothing here is written to the catalogue until Curate. That sentence is
 * the one misconception worth pre-empting, and it is on the pane.

// whether THIS source actually made it to Egeria (confirmed live: an
// adventureworks source sat local-only, origin='local', on an already-
// published resource, with nothing on the row saying so) — round 1 fixed
// that to four states. Round 4 added `not_catalogued`: a row with a ref
// guid but no link guid and nothing pending/running used to render
// `publishing` with no outbox row backing that claim at all (a second
// find-absence-as-answer bug, this time about the STATE ITSELF rather than
// the header note) — see `derive_doc_source_egeria_state` (backend) for the
