/* Enrichment — Context, the stage's new first sub-tab (ENRICHMENT-E1-
 * CONTEXT-TAB, replying to docs/design-notes/REPLY-DESIGNER-ENRICHMENT-
 * STAGE-IA.md §1). Builds on E0 (ENRICHMENT-E0-ROW-ANATOMY): the shared row
 * anatomy (`row-anatomy.js`'s `personRowLineHtml`) and the inline
 * question-answer editor E0 built with no Context tab to live in yet.
 *
 * Five sections, in the reply's own order (§1):
 *   1. What we judge        — the judgement fields, moved here from the old
 *                              merged Enrichment/Questions pane.
 *   2. What you're looking for — the lens. Read-only, sourced from the
 *                              investigation, not the resource (§1: "the
 *                              lens belongs to the investigation").
 *   3. What we record       — the observation fields.
 *   4. What only you can answer — the catalog's human questions, with E0's
 *                              inline editor now given a real home.
 *   5. Where it's documented — #348's block (db and filesystem), mounted
 *                              unchanged via `renderDocSources`; E2 applies
 *                              the reply's corrections in place.
 *
 * Every row ends with a "feeds →" line (§1) naming which downstream
 * consumer(s) read the field — see `feedsLine()`.
 *
 * Judgements/observations reuse `stages/enrichment.js`'s `fieldRowHtml` and
 * its save-control wiring unchanged (`wireEnrichmentFieldControls`,
 * extracted from that file's `renderEnrichmentForm` so both this tab and
 * that file's own render path share one implementation rather than two).

 *
 *  Neither link target exists as a built UI today — confirmed by search

 *  stamps on a supplied-but-unlabeled lens dict — there is no click path
 *  that supplies one. So this row reads the absence honestly (from
 *  `preliminary_fit`'s own last-read `lens_declared` flag — the one real
 *  stored signal that exists) and marks BOTH links "not built in /next",
 *  the same dashed-underline convention every other deferred affordance in
