/* Assessment.
 *
 * PLAN-FINISH-REPOS.md item 11: Assessment is now `built: true` in app.js's
 * `STAGES` array. It needed no bespoke renderer -- the generic
 * Questions-checklist engine (`loadPane()` in app.js) already reaches it
 * correctly, the same as Scouting/Enrichment/Curate, because the catalog
 * carries 15 real Assessment-tagged questions (question_catalog.yaml)
 * backed by 15 `intent: assessment` analyses (analysis_catalog.yaml) --
 * see docs/design-notes/
 * ITEM-11-DISCOVERY-ASSESSMENT-ANALYSIS-IMPLEMENTED.md for how this was
 * verified. Classic has no bespoke Assessment UI or backend either -- it
 * reuses the same generic catalog-card/dashboard shell as Discovery and
 * Analysis, pointed at `intent: assessment` catalog entries -- so there is
 * nothing classic-specific to port or defer here.
