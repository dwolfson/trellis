"""What admits a node to a blueprint, as RE records and shows it (DESIGN-BLUEPRINT-NODE-ADMISSION.md).

The detectors tag every component with an evidence class (`surveyors/arch_recovery/admission.py`):
built here, shipped here, or referenced only. This module is the registry side:

* `reclassify`: a person may say a node is built here after all, or only referenced, WITH A REASON. The
  trail is append-only in `app_settings`, ONE KEY PER ENTRY (`repo_node_reclassifications::<slug>::<time>-<id>`,
  written once, never updated; the latest entry per scope wins), no schema change, and it is read both at survey time (so the next survey
  honours it) and at read time (so the move shows at once).
* `referenced_rows`: the referenced-only services that are runtime dependencies, with the person's
  reclassifications applied. `dependency_table` lists them as kind `runtime`.
* `summary`: what was admitted by class, what was found and not admitted (the blueprint manifest's
  lines), and the zero-component sentence.
* `environment`: the Environment Deployment Blueprint's nodes: services that are other projects'
  deployment units, each linked to the repository RE knows to build the image.

Nothing here contacts Egeria.
