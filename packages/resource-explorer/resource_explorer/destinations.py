"""Where a finding belongs — on the resource, or on the analysis.

The designer's note (scratchpad SPEC-ACTIONABLE-AND-HONEST.md §3, "Making it
actionable — the missing half is whose absence it is"): the honesty rules this
codebase already applies (result_status.py, facts.py) are scrupulous about
what a finding cannot say and silent about what to do with it. Every finding
about the repository names one of three destinations — `judgement`, `task`,
`context` — and a finding about the ANALYSIS (a disagreement between two
measures, or a check that could not be run) belongs to neither: it goes in the
gaps collection (see gaps.py), marked `ours`.

    judgement  a scored/evaluative finding with no single correct action —
               it becomes an Enrichment field, and the link goes to the
               judgement it informs (e.g. elephant factor — sole; is that a
               risk HERE depends on what the repo is for).
    task       an absence someone can fix — raise an RFA against the repo.
    context    a fact. Not a failure, and not pretending otherwise: a finding
               that implies no action is not a chore.
    ours       computed, never declared — the analysis, not the repository,
               owns this finding (a disagreement between two measures, or a
               check that could not be established). See gaps.py.

`resolve_destination` is the one place that decides this, so a check's
declared default and a label override cannot each answer differently from
what the gaps collection independently detects. It reads
configdata/check_registry.yaml, which is the existing per-check vocabulary
(see that file's own header for `findings_kind` vs. analysis id and the
instance-keyed exclusions) extended with an optional `destinations:` map
alongside each analysis's `checks:` list, plus a `whole_analysis_destinations:`
top-level section for the analyses that answer as a whole (check_registry.yaml
`whole_analysis_only`).

    `whole_analysis_only` id). `check_name` is the check within it — pass the
    analysis id again (or "") for a whole-analysis-only finding. `label` is
    the finding's own value/classification (e.g. "sole", "not_established").
    `state` is the caller's result_status state for THIS finding, or
    `DISAGREEMENT` when the caller has independently determined this finding
    is a cross-analysis disagreement — resolve_destination never detects a
    disagreement itself, it only reacts to being told one.

    Resolution order (never revisited once a rule matches):

    1. `state == DISAGREEMENT`, or `state`/`label` is NOT_ESTABLISHED (ran,
       but this analysis cannot be credited with the result — result_status's
       own vocabulary) -> `ours`, computed. This is the one destination a
       check must never declare statically: whether a finding is a
       disagreement or unestablished is discovered per-resource, per-run, and
       a static registry entry could not know it in advance.
    2. A label-specific override in the check's `destinations.labels` map.
    3. The check's `destinations.default`.
    4. `context`, "no destination declared" — a real, queryable gap (see
       tests/test_destinations.py's registry-coverage report) rather than a
       silent default that looks the same as a considered choice.
