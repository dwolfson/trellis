"""RE's direct read/write access to the `.omsecrets` YAML file.

Background — docs/design-notes/REPLY-DATABASE-CREDENTIAL-CAPABILITY-
VISIBILITY.md §7: RE writes a credential to two places in the same
operation — its own registry (`registry.py`'s `databases.db_password`,
encrypted at rest via `credential_crypto.py`) and this file, which is the
"projection for the engine host". Egeria's own YAML secrets-store connector
(`YAMLSecretsFileConnector`) is what actually READS this file at survey
time; RE never asks Egeria to read a secret back (pyegeria exposes no such
API — see credential_crypto.py's docstring), it only keeps its own copy of
what it wrote in sync with what the engine host sees.

File shape — confirmed live against the real file in this dev environment
(`egeria-workspaces-fs/runtime-volumes/quickstart-platform-data/secrets/
resource-explorer.omsecrets`, hand-edited earlier this session), not
guessed from the design doc's paraphrase:

    ---
    secretsCollections:
      <collection name>:
        displayName: "<collection name>"
        refreshTimeInterval: 60
        secrets:
          userId: "<user>"
          clearPassword: "<password>"

Path configuration
-------------------
`config.egeria.secrets_store_local_path` (`EGERIA_SECRETS_STORE_LOCAL_PATH`)
is the host-visible path to this file — see that field's docstring in
config.py for why it is a SEPARATE setting from `secrets_store_path_name`
(that one is the engine-host-container path RE hands to Egeria, and is not
a path RE itself, running as a bare host process, can open). Empty by
default. Every function here degrades to a silent no-op when it is unset,
since most deployments (CI, a from-scratch checkout, a remote engine host)
have no host-visible path to this file at all — this must never be an
error, only "there is nothing to project to."

    nothing needs reconstructing from `server_slug`/`database_name`, since
    that's what the slug already encodes.

    Kept as the single definition RE uses; `surveyors/database/

    path — not unified here to stay inside this change's stated scope
