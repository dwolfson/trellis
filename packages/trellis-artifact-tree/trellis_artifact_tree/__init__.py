"""Shared containment tree over ingested artifacts.

See README.md for why this is a package rather than one app's table.

CodeAdapter and PdfAdapter are importable without their extras installed -- they
import tree_sitter and docling inside parse(), so a missing extra surfaces at
the point of use with an install hint rather than as an import-time stack trace.
Neither is in AdapterRegistry's defaults: the default registry stays stdlib-only
(markdown plus the generic fallback), and an app registers what it installed.
