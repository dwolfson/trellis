# just saves typing the full invocation for the common cases. Anything not
# covered by a target still works via `make re CMD="..."` / `make ea CMD="..."`
# or the raw `uv run --package ...` form.

## Start-up
# ./trellis-up wraps the targets above with the two things they do not do:
# it makes sure a shared TRELLIS_JWT_SECRET exists in BOTH packages' .env
# (absent one, each app derives a secret from its hostname -- no error, just
# sessions that do not survive a restart or move), and it says up front when
# Egeria, Postgres or Ollama is unreachable rather than letting the app fail
# later. `dev`/`re-web`/`ea-web` above remain the direct route when the
# environment is already known-good.

up: ## Preflight, ensure secrets, then start both apps natively
	./trellis-up

up-re: ## Same, Resource Explorer only
	./trellis-up --re

up-ea: ## Same, Egeria Advisor only
	./trellis-up --ea

up-container: ## Start both via the trellis compose overlay in egeria-workspaces-fs (needs `make images`)
	./trellis-up --container

check: ## Preflight only -- report what is missing, start nothing, write nothing
	./trellis-up --check

# `make ps` — what is actually running, in one command.
#
# Exists because finding thirteen orphaned Prefect ephemeral API servers on
# Dev 1 on 2026-09-04 took four separate tool calls and a guess about what to
# grep for (docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md §2: "make ps lists every
# trellis-owned process and container with role, pid, age and port"). Some of
# those orphans were four days old; nothing would have surfaced them.
#
# Plain shell on purpose — no new dependency, and it has to work on a box
# where the thing being diagnosed is that a Python process is wedged. lsof is
# used for ports only if present, and its absence degrades to a blank column
# rather than an error, same as `docker ps` failing when Docker is not up.

# Maintenance scripts. These exist as targets because running them from the
# wrong checkout is a real hazard, not a hypothetical one: this workspace has
# four clones of the repo on different branches sharing ONE database, and a
# sweep run from a stale one on 2026-08-26 cleared 23 asset GUIDs while leaving
# 97 publish claims behind — the older script simply did not know about them.
# `uv run --package` resolves from the workspace root, so these always run the
# code that belongs with the tree you invoke them from.

## Container images
# Step 3 of docs/runtime-architecture-plan.md: one image per app, built for
# both arm64 and amd64 in CI (.github/workflows/images.yml), used unchanged
# by the dev profile (as an artifact — dev boxes still run native `uv run`)
# and by the demo profile (as the running container). These targets are the
# local, single-arch (host-arch) equivalent for building and smoke-testing
# on a dev box; they intentionally do not push anywhere.
#
# image-run-re assumes the shared-infra compose network from
# egeria-workspaces-fs (compose-configs/shared-infra/shared-infra.yaml) is
# already up — `egeria_network`, with Postgres reachable in-network as
# `egeria-shared-postgres`. Picks a port off the two the user's native
# servers hold (8810 RE, 8880 EA per re-web/ea-web above): 8811.
